One of these adaptive controls, namely, the mode of training provided, is then empirically tested for its effectiveness.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn total, 1,048 working Australian adults completed the human aspects of the information security questionnaire (HAIS-Q) to determine their individual information security awareness (ISA). This included questions relating to the various modes of cyber-security training they had received and how often it was provided. Also, a set of questions called the cyber-security learning-styles inventory was used to identify their preferred learning styles for training.\n\n\nFindings\nThe extent to which the training that an individual received matched their learning preferences was positively associated with their information security awareness (ISA) level. However, the frequency of such training did not directly predict ISA levels.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nFurther research should examine the influence of matching cyber-security learning styles to training packages more directly by conducting a controlled trial where the training packages provided differ only in the mode of learning. Further research should also investigate how individual tailoring of aspects of an adaptive control framework (ACF), other than training, may improve ISA.\n\n\nPractical implications\nIf cyber-security training is adapted to the preferred learning styles of individuals, their level of ISA will improve, and therefore, their non-malicious behaviour, whilst using a digital device to do their work, will be safer.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nA review of the literature confirmed that ACFs for cyber-security does exist, but only in terms of hardware and software controls. There is no evidence of any literature on frameworks that include controls that are adaptable to human factors within the context of information security. In addition, this is the first study to show that ISA is improved when cyber-security training is provided in line with an individual’s preferred learning style. Similar improvement was not evident when the training frequency was increased suggesting real-world improvements in ISA may be possible without increasing training budgets but by simply matching individuals to their desired mode of training.\n",

The externalization of the normalization process, executed by several distributed mobile agents on interconnected computers and devices, proposes a SIEM server dedicated mainly for correlation and analysis.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe architecture has been proposed in three stages. In the first step, the authors described the different aspects of the proposed approach. Then they implemented the proposed architecture and presented a new vision for the insertion of normalized data into the SIEM database. Finally, the authors performed a numerical comparison between the approach used in the proposed architecture and that of existing SIEM systems.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results of the experiments showed that MA-SIEM systems are more efficient than existing SIEM systems because they leave the SIEM resources primarily dedicated to advanced correlation analysis. In addition, this paper takes into account realistic scenarios and use-cases and proposes a fully automated process for transferring normalized events in near real time to the SIEM server for further analysis using mobile agents.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe work provides new insights into the normalization security-related events using light mobile agents.\n",

This study aims to explore how the 7Ps (product, price, promotion, place, physical evidence, process and people) marketing mix, as part of an internal social marketing approach, can be used to gain an understanding of employees’ interactions within an organization’s cybersecurity environment. This understanding could inform the design of servicescapes and behavioral infrastructure to promote and maintain cybersecurity compliance.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study adopted an inductive qualitative approach using in-depth interviews with employees in several Vietnamese organizations. Discussions were centered on employee experiences and their perceptions of cybersecurity initiatives, as well as the impact of initiatives on compliance behavior. Responses were then categorized under the 7Ps marketing mix framework.\n\n\nFindings\nThe study shows that assessing a cybersecurity program using the 7P mix enables the systematic capture of users’ security compliance and acceptance of IT systems. Additionally, understanding the interactions between system elements permits the design of behavioral infrastructure to enhance security efforts. Results also show that user engagement is essential in developing secure systems. User engagement requires developing shared objectives, localized communications, co-designing of efficient processes and understanding the “pain points” of security compliance. The knowledge developed from this research provides a framework for those managing cybersecurity systems and enables the design human-centered systems conducive to compliance.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe study is one of the first to use a cross-disciplinary social marketing approach to examine how employees experience and comply with security initiatives. Previous studies have mostly focused on determinants of compliance behavior without providing a clear platform for management action.

This study aims to investigate factors that motivate and hinder a customer’s willingness to disclose personal information (WTD) to online firms on e-commerce websites.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nBased on an extensive literature review, three sets of factors have been identified. These sets of factors are privacy concern, perceived disclosure benefits and privacy assurances. It is hypothesized that privacy concerns negatively affect the disclosure of personal information, while the perceived benefits of disclosure have positive effects. Privacy assurances would positively affect information disclosure and attenuate the negative effect of privacy concerns on the disclosure of personal information. The authors gathered data from 253 online customers in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results indicate that perceived disclosure benefits and privacy concerns have a significant positive and negative relationship, respectively, with WTD online. Privacy assurances had neither a direct nor a moderating effect on information disclosure.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe findings will inform online firms about the factors that prevent or motivate customers to disclose personal information.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe effect of privacy concerns and benefits on personal information disclosure are not fully understood in Saudi Arabia. This study reveals more insights into the specific factors that make online customers reluctant or motivated to disclose their personal information.\n",

Privacy studies typically focus on individual privacy; however, in the era of big data analytics, users are also targeted as members of specific groups, thus challenging their collective privacy with unidentified implications. Overall, this paper aims to argue that in the age of big data, there is a need to consider the collective aspects of privacy as well and to develop new ways of calculating privacy risks and identify privacy threats that emerge.Design/methodology/approachFocusing on a collective level, the authors conducted an extensive literature review related to information privacy and concepts of social identity. They also examined numerous automated data-driven profiling techniques analyzing at the same time the involved privacy issues for groups.FindingsThis paper identifies privacy threats for collective entities that stem from data-driven profiling, and it argues that privacy-preserving mechanisms are required to protect the privacy interests of groups as entities, independently of the interests of their individual members. Moreover, this paper concludes that collective privacy threats may be different from threats for individuals when they are not members of a group.Originality/valueAlthough research evidence indicates that in the age of big data privacy as a collective issue is becoming increasingly important, the pluralist character of privacy has not yet been adequately explored. This paper contributes to filling this gap and provides new insights with regard to threats for group privacy and their impact on collective entities and society.",

Several questions have been raised about the reliability of these promising but ambiguous offers, as the adoption of a cloud solution within an enterprise is generally accompanied by a change in the chief information officer (CIOs) role and loss of expertise.,The research uses a mixed research methodology: a first step is based on a questionnaire survey to investigate the security aspects of open source and understand the role of CIOs in the migration process. The investigation involved nearly 800 companies operating in the cloud computing sector in 16 European countries between November 2015 and January 2016. Then, this paper completes the research with a qualitative study by examining the activity of two sample companies.,Research confirms that open source cloud solutions offer a higher level of security than proprietary solutions. It is also noted that the role of CIOs is delegated to a third external actor: a transition CIO. Transition CIO is the guarantor of the strategic and security choices of small and medium enterprises.,These findings have important implications and great value to managers and cloud computing providers, in terms of formulating better cloud computing solutions. This study can also assist in increasing their understanding of the new role of CIO in the migration process to cloud computing.,This study contributes to the body of research on cloud computing. It is first of its kind with its focus on open source alternatives. Another novelty of this research is that it suggests a new conception for the CIOs role in the migration to cloud computing.

Design/methodology/approach: The intention of the authors was to conduct a systematic literature review. However, owing to limited empirical papers in ISG research, this paper is more conceptually organised. Findings: This paper shows that security has shifted from a narrow-focused isolated issue towards a strategic business issue with “from the basement to the boardroom” implications. The key takeaway is that protecting the organisation is important, but organizations must also develop strategies to ensure resilient businesses to take advantage of the opportunities that digitalization can bring. Research limitations/implications: The concept of DSG is a new research territory that addresses the limitations and gaps of traditional ISG approaches in a digital context. To this extent, organisational theories are suggested to help build knowledge that offers a deeper understanding than that provided by the too often used practical approaches in ISG research. Practical implications: This paper supports practitioners and decision makers by providing a deeper understanding of how organisations and their security approaches are actually affected by digitalisation. Social implications: This paper helps individuals to understand that they have increasing rights with regard to privacy and security and a say in what parties they assign business to.

They have less experience in dealing with the Internet-enabled device and hence less experience in handling security threats like malware as compared to users of other countries who have gone through the learning curve of handling such security threats using other Internet-enabled devices such as laptop and desktop. Because of this, the inexperienced Indian smartphone user may be vulnerable to Internet-related security breaches, as compared to the citizens of developed economies. Hence, it is essential to understand the attitude, behaviour and security practices of smartphone users in India. Limited research is available about the security behaviour of smartphone users in India as the majority of research in this domain is done outside India.,In this empirical study, the researchers identified 28 cybersecurity behaviours and practices through a survey of relevant literature. An online survey of identified cybersecurity behaviours and practices was administered to 300 smartphone users. Frequency analysis of the respondent data was done to understand the adoption of recommended cybersecurity behaviours and practices. Pearson’s chi-square with 5% level of significance has been used to test the hypotheses. Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction was conducted for statistically significant associations.,Overall, the respondents did not exhibit good cybersecurity behaviour. Respondents have adopted some of the most popular security features of the smartphone such as the use of screen lock. However, respondents have not adopted or are not aware of the technical security controls such as encryption and remote wipe. Statistically significant differences were found between the cybersecurity behaviour and practices and independent variables such as gender, age, mobile operating system (OS) and mother tongue. Respondents reported high level of motivation to protect their device and data, whereas they reported moderate level of threat awareness and the ability to protect to their device and data. Results of the comparative analysis with a similar study in China and the USA are also reported in this study.,The main limitations of this study are as follows: the respondents' perceptions about their cybersecurity behaviours and practices were measured as opposed to their actual behaviours and practices and the generalizability of the study is limited because the sample size is small as compared to the total number of smartphone users in India.,The findings of this study may be useful for the design of effective cybersecurity prevention and intervention programs for general smartphone users of India.,This study provides an insight about cybersecurity behaviour of smartphone users in India. To the knowledge of the researchers, this is the first study to collect such quantitative data of smartphone users in India for a better understanding of the cybersecurity behaviours and practices. This study identified 28 cybersecurity behaviours and practices, which smartphone users should follow to improve cybersecurity.",

This study aims to expand the domain of health-care cyber security maturity model by including cloud-specific aspects than is usually seen in the literature.,The intended use of the proposed model was demonstrated using the evaluation method – “construct validity test” as the paper’s aim was to assess the final model and the output of the valuation. The study involved a literature-based case study of a national health-care foundation trust with an overall view because the model is assessed for the entire organisation. The data were complemented by examination of hospitals’ cyber security internal processes through web-accessible documents, and identified relevant literature.,The paper provides awareness about how organisational-related challenges have been identified as a main inhibiting factor for the adoption of cloud computing in health care. Regardless of the remunerations of cloud computing, its security maturity and levels of adoption varies, especially in health care. Maturity models provide a structure towards improving an organisation’s capabilities. It suggests that although several cyber security maturity models and standards resolving specific threats exist, there is a lack of maturity models for cloud-based health-care security.,Due to the selected research method, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, future research studies can investigate the propositions further. Another is that the current thresholds were determined empirically, although it worked for the case study assessment. However, to establish more realistic threshold levels, there is a need for more validation of the model using more case studies.,The paper includes maturity model for the assessment management and improvement of the security posture of a health-care organisation actively using cloud. For executives, it provides a detailed security assessment of the eHealth cloud to aid in decision making. For security experts, its quantitative metrics support proactive and reactive processes.,The paper fulfils a recognised requirement for security maturity model focussed on health-care cloud.

However, this can create security and privacy risks to patient information. This paper aims to present a model for securing the EHR based on role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC) and the Clark-Wilson model.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA systematic literature review was conducted which resulted in the collection of secondary data that was used as the content analysis sample. Using the MAXQDA software program, the secondary data was analysed quantitatively using content analysis, resulting in 2,856 tags, which informed the discussion. An expert review was conducted to evaluate the proposed model using an evaluation framework.\n\n\nFindings\nThe study found that a combination of RBAC, ABAC and the Clark-Wilson model may be used to secure the EHR. While RBAC is applicable to healthcare, as roles are linked to an organisation’s structure, its lack of dynamic authorisation is addressed by ABAC. Additionally, key concepts of the Clark-Wilson model such as well-formed transactions, authentication, separation of duties and auditing can be used to secure the EHR.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nAlthough previous studies have been based on a combination of RBAC and ABAC, this study also uses key concepts of the Clark-Wilson model for securing the EHR. Countries implementing the EHR can use the model proposed by this study to help secure the EHR while also providing EHR access in a medical emergency.\n",

In fact, fertilizers and pesticides play a crucial role in agriculture, representing a powerful tool for growers to increase yield and guarantee continuous productivity throughout the seasons under both optimal and suboptimal conditions. In the last three decades, several technological innovations have been proposed to enhance the sustainability of agricultural production systems, through a significant reduction of synthetic agrochemicals like pesticides and fertilizers. A promising and environmental-friendly innovation would be the use of natural plant biostimulants (PBs) that enhance flowering, plant growth, fruit set, crop productivity, and nutrient use efficiency (NUE), and are able also to improve the tolerance against a wide range of abiotic stressors (Colla and Rouphael, 2015). PBs were initially defined by excluding some functionalities like fertilizers or plant protection products. In 1997, in Grounds Maintenance web-journal, Zhang and Schmidt from the Department of Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, defined PBs as “materials that, in minute quantities, promote plant growth”. By using the statement “minute quantities” for describing PBs, the authors implicitly wanted to discriminate biostimulants from nutrients and soil amendments, which also promote plant growth, but are clearly applied in larger quantities. The PBs mentioned in this web article were two important categories such as humic acids and seaweed extracts, and their action on plants was proposed to be essentially hormonal. In 2012, the European Commission has assigned an ad hoc study on plant biostimulants to evaluate the substances and materials involved, which was published by du Jardin (2012) as: “The Science of Plant Biostimulants A bibliographic Analysis”. Based on the scientific literature (250 scientific articles using the term ‘biostimulant' in their titles and/or abstracts), the following definition was proposed: “Plant biostimulants are substances and materials, with the exception of nutrients and pesticides, which, when applied to plant, seeds or growing substrates in specific formulations, have the capacity to modify physiological processes of plants in a way that provides potential benefits to growth, development and/or stress responses”. du Jardin (2012) concluded that PBs are very heterogeneous materials, and proposed in his study eight categories of substances that acts as biostimulants: humic substances, complex organic materials (obtained from agro-industrial and urban waste products, sewage sludge extracts, composts, and manure), beneficial chemical elements (Al, Co, Na, Se, and Si), inorganic salts including phosphite, seaweed extracts (brown, red, and green",

Personal information of four newly created consumer profiles was deposited to 10 random insurance organisation websites in each country to evaluate a number of data privacy requirements of the Data Protection Act and Protection of Personal Information Act.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results demonstrate that not all the insurance organisations honored the selected opt-out preference for receiving direct marketing material. This was evident in direct marketing material that was sent from the insurance organisations in the sample to both the SA and UK consumer profiles who opted out for it. A total of 42 unsolicited third-party contacts were received by the SA consumer profiles, whereas the UK consumer profiles did not receive any third-party direct marketing. It was also found that the minimality principle is not always met by both SA and UK organisations.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nAs a jurisdiction with a heavy stance towards privacy implementation and regulation, it was found that the UK is more compliant than SA in terms of implementation of the evaluated data protection requirements included in the scope of this study, however not fully compliant.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nBased upon the results obtained from this research, it suggests that the SA insurance organisations should ensure that the non-compliance aspects relating to direct marketing and sharing data with third parties are addressed. SA insurance companies should learn from the manner in which the UK insurance organisations implement these privacy requirements. Furthermore, the UK insurance organisations should focus on improved compliance for direct marking and the minimality principle.

An integral step in the first line of defense against various forms of attacks are (written) security policies designed to prescribe the construction and function of a technical system, while simultaneously guiding the actions of individuals operating within said system. Unfortunately, policy analysis is an insufficiently discussed topic in many academic communities with very little research being conducted in this space.,This work aims to assess the current state of information security policies by analyzing in-use policies from 200 universities and colleges in the USA with the goal of identifying important features and general attributes of these documents. The authors accomplish this through a series of analyzes designed to examine the language and construction of these policies.,To summarize high-level results, the authors found that only 54 per cent of the top 200 universities had publicly accessible information security policies, and the policies that were examined lacked consistency with little shared source material. The authors also found that the tonal makeup of these policies lacked a great deal of emotion, but contained a high amount of tentative or ambiguous language leading toward policies that could be viewed as “unclear.”,This work is an extension of a paper that was presented at ECIS 2018.

The expected biases are because of social desirability and because of biases based on identity theory.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA survey was conducted (n = 54) that used policy compliance scales from literature and the developed self-reporting policy compliance (SRPC) scale, along with the Marlow–Crowne social desirability (MC-SDB) scale. Differences between the policy compliance scales were assessed. Moreover, a transformation of the SRPC measurements into the literature-based scales was examined using pair-wise t-testing. Finally, correlations between the MC-SDB and the policy compliance scales were examined.\n\n\nFindings\nThere are no significant influences on the desire for social approval of the respondents as was exhibited by the MC-SDB values and policy compliance on either scale. However, the SRPC scale measurements show deviations from the literature-based policy compliance scales. Individuals that exhibit secure behaviour, which is not rooted in a policy but rather in anything but the policy, are also captured as being policy compliant in the current scales. This shows that a response bias exists in current scales. Respondents, who perceive to exhibit secure behaviours, may think that they are in compliance with the policy, even when they are not.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThese findings mean that several contributions in the field of policy compliance must be questioned and that a revisit of several factors influencing policy compliance may be required.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, response biases in policy compliance research have not been considered to date.\n",

It uses guidelines based on work system theory (WST) to frame the results, thereby illustrating why the mere existence of corporate security policies or general security training often is insufficient for establishing and maintaining information security. Design/methodology/approach: This research was designed to produce a better appreciation and understanding of potential issues or gaps in security practices in SMEs. The research team interviewed 187 employees of 39 SMEs in the UK. All of those employees had access to sensitive information. Gathering information through interviews (instead of formal security documentation) made it possible to assess security practices from employees’ point of view. Findings: Corporate policies that highlight information security are often disconnected from actual work practices and routines and often do not receive high priority in everyday work practices. A vast majority of the interviewed employees are not involved in risk assessment or in the development of security practices. Security practices remain an illusory activity in their real-world contexts. Research limitations/implications: This paper focuses only on closed-ended questions related to the following topics: awareness of existing security policy; information security practices and management and information security involvement. Practical implications: The empirical findings show that corporate information security policies in SMEs often are insufficient for maintaining security unless those policies are integrated with visible and recognized work practices in work systems that use or produce sensitive information. The interpretation based on WST provides guidelines for enhancing information system security. Originality/value: Beyond merely reporting empirical results, this research uses WST to interpret the results in a way that has direct implications for practitioners and for researchers. (Less)",

Users may be the customers of the organization (people using the offered services) or the employees (users who operate the systems of the organization). To be more specific, this paper proposes a privacy impact assessment (PIA) method that explicitly takes into account the organizational characteristics and employs a list of well-defined metrics as input, demonstrating its applicability to two hospital information systems with different characteristics.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper presents a PIA method that employs metrics and takes into account the peculiarities and other characteristics of the organization. The applicability of the method has been demonstrated on two Hospital Information Systems with different characteristics. The aim is to assist the organizations to estimate the criticality of potential privacy breaches and, thus, to select the appropriate security measures for the protection of the data that they collect, process and store.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results of the proposed PIA method highlight the criticality of each privacy principle for every data set maintained by the organization. The method employed for the calculation of the criticality level, takes into account the consequences that the organization may experience in case of a security or privacy violation incident on a specific data set, the weighting of each privacy principle and the unique characteristics of each organization. So, the results of the proposed PIA method offer a strong indication of the security measures and privacy enforcement mechanisms that the organization should adopt to effectively protect its data.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe novelty of the method is that it handles security and privacy requirements simultaneously, as it uses the results of risk analysis together with those of a PIA. A further novelty of the method is that it introduces metrics for the quantification of the requirements and also that it takes into account the specific characteristics of the organization.\n",

GDPR compliance is a challenging matter for the relevant stakeholders calls for a software platform that can support their needs. The aim of data governance for supporting GDPR (DEFeND) EU project is to deliver such a platform. The purpose of this paper is to describe the process, within the DEFeND EU project, for eliciting and analyzing requirements for such a complex platform.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe platform needs to satisfy legal and privacy requirements and provide functionalities that data controllers request for supporting GDPR compliance. Further, it needs to satisfy acceptance requirements, for assuring that its users will embrace and use the platform. In this paper, the authors describe the methodology for eliciting and analyzing requirements for such a complex platform, by analyzing data attained by stakeholders from different sectors.\n\n\nFindings\nThe findings provide the process for the DEFeND platform requirements’ elicitation and an indicative sample of those. The authors also describe the implementation of a secondary process for consolidating the elicited requirements into a consistent set of platform requirements.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe proposed software engineering methodology and data collection tools (i.e. questionnaires) are expected to have a significant impact for software engineers in academia and industry.\n\n\nSocial implications\nIt is reported repeatedly that data controllers face difficulties in complying with the GDPR.

This threat is known as an “Insider IT Sabotage” threat. This involves employees misusing their access rights to harm the organization. Events leading up to the attack are not technical but rather behavioural. The problem is that owing to the high volume and complexity of emails, the risk of insider IT sabotage cannot be diminished with rule-based approaches.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nMalicious human behaviours that insiders within the insider IT sabotage category would possess are studied and mapped to phrases that would appear in email communications. A large email data set is classified according to behavioural characteristics of these employees. Machine learning algorithms are used to identify occurrences of this insider threat type. The accuracy of these approaches is measured.\n\n\nFindings\nIt is shown in this paper that suspicious behaviour of disgruntled employees can be discovered, by means of machine intelligence techniques. The output of the machine learning classifier depends mainly on the depth and quality of the phrases and behaviour analysis, cleansing and number of email attributes examined. This process of labelling content in isolation could be improved if other attributes of the email data are included, such that a confidence score can be computed for each user.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis research presents a novel approach to show that the creation of a prototype that can automate the detection of insider IT sabotage within email systems to mitigate the risk within organizations.\n",

This study was conducted throughout Malaysia with a total of 250 valid questionnaires obtained from managers and executives from the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)-status companies. Structural equation modelling (SEM) using partial least square was used to analyse the data and to test all nine hypotheses developed in this study.,Findings from this study indicate that operational agility (OA) is significantly related to ISM practices in MSC-status companies. The validation of the structural model of nine hypotheses developed for this study has demonstrated satisfactory results, exhibited six significant direct relationships and three insignificant relationships.,This study has addressed the needs for a comprehensive, coherent and empirically tested ISM practices and organisational agility framework. The current theoretical framework used in this study emphasised on the ISM–organisational agility dimensions that are predominantly important to ascertain high level of ISM practices and perceived agility level among the information technology (IT) business companies in Malaysia. With the application of SEM for powerful analysis, the empirical-based framework established in this study was validated by the empirical findings, thus contributing significantly to the field of information security (InfoSec).,This study has filled the research gap between different constructs of ISM practices and OA. The model put forth in this study contributes in several ways to the InfoSec research community. The recognition of InfoSec practices that could facilitate organisational agility in the IT industry in Malaysia is vital and contributes to more value creation for the organisations.",

Even if several authentication methods are in existence, using passwords remain the most common type of authentication. As long and complex passwords are encouraged by research studies and practitioners alike, computer users design passwords using strategies that enable them to remember their passwords. This paper aims to find strategies that allow for the generation of passwords that are both memorable and computationally secure.,The study began with a literature review that was used to identify cognitive password creation strategies that facilitate the creation of passwords that are easy to remember. Using an action-based approach, attack models were created for the resulting creation strategies. The attack models were then used to calculate the entropy for passwords created with different strategies and related to a theoretical cracking time.,The result of this study suggests that using phrases with four or more words as passwords will generate passwords that are easy to remember and hard to attack.,This paper considers passwords from a socio-technical approach and provides insight into how passwords that are easy to remember and hard to crack can be generated. The results can be directly used to create password guidelines and training material that enables users to create usable and secure passwords.",

                    "abstract": "Trust is one of the main pillars of many communication and interaction domains. Computing is no exception. Fog computing (FC) has emerged as mitigation of several cloud computing limitations. However, selecting a trustworthy node from the fog network still presents serious challenges. This paper aims to propose an algorithm intended to mitigate the trust and the security issues related to selecting a node of a fog network.,The proposed model/algorithm is based on two main concepts, namely, machine learning using fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) and the weighted weakest link (WWL) algorithm. The crux of the proposed model is to be trained, validated and used to classify the fog nodes according to their trust scores. A total of 2,482 certified computing products, in addition to a set of nodes composed of multiple items, are used to train, validate and test the proposed model. A scenario including nodes composed of multiple computing items is designed for applying and evaluating the performance of the proposed model/algorithm.,The results show a well-performing trust model with an accuracy of 0.9996. Thus, the end-users of FC services adopting the proposed approach could be more confident when selecting elected fog nodes. The trained, validated and tested model was able to classify the nodes according to their trust level. The proposed model is a novel approach to fog nodes selection in a fog network.,Certainly, all data could be collected, however, some features are very difficult to have their scores. Available techniques such as regression analysis and the use of the experts have their own limitations. Experts might be subjective, even though the author used the fuzzy group decision-making model to mitigate the subjectivity effect. A methodical evaluation by specialized bodies such as the security certification process is paramount to mitigate these issues. The author recommends the repetition of the same study when data form such bodies is available.,The novel combination of FNN and WWL in a trust model mitigates uncertainty, subjectivity and enables the trust classification of complex FC nodes. Furthermore, the combination also allowed the classification of fog nodes composed of diverse computing items, which is not possible without the WWL. The proposed algorithm will provide the required intelligence for end-users (devices) to make sound decisions when requesting fog services.",

The studies were primarily identified from querying the Scopus database. The authors identified 19 studies which lead to the identification of 37 effect sizes, based on a total sample of N = 23,146 subjects.

All analyses were performed using random-effects models, and heterogeneity was quantified.FindingsThe authors find substantial differences in effect size for the different interventions. Some interventions are highly effective; others have no effect at all. Highly intensive interventions are more effective than those that are low on intensity.

Phishing attacks involved the process of sending out electronic mails impersonating the valid banking institutions to their customers and demanding confidential data such as credential and transaction authorisation code. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical model of individual and technological factors influencing Malaysian internet banking users’ intention in responding to malicious uniform resource locator (URL) in phishing email content.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIt applied the protective motivation theory, the theories of reasoned action and planned behaviour, the habit theory and the trust theory to examine the factors influencing internet banking users’ intention to click URLs in phishing emails. The study identifies individual and technological factors with ten hypotheses. A total of 368 Malaysian respondents voluntarily participated in an online survey conducted in the first week of March 2021. The partial least squares method provided in SmartPLS-3 was used to model the data.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results revealed that individual factors, namely, internet banking experience, understanding the phishing meaning, response cost, trust and perceived ability were the significant influencing factors of internet banking users’ intention to click the link in phishing emails. This study also suggested that technological factors were not relevant in describing the behavioural intention of internet banking users in clicking the links in phishing emails.\n\n\nSocial implications\nThe findings could contribute to Malaysian banking sectors and relevant government agencies in educating and increasing internet banking users’ awareness towards phishing emails.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe outcomes demonstrated the individual factors that influenced internet banking users’ intention in responding to phishing emails that are specific and relevant to Malaysia’s context.\n",

Additionally, it aims to identify a set of good practices that can be adopted by software engineering companies.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study uses a qualitative methodology through four case studies involving Portuguese software engineering companies. Two of these companies are small and medium enterprises (SMEs) while the other remaining two are micro-companies. The thematic analysis is adopted to identify patterns in the performed interviews.\n\n\nFindings\nThe findings indicate that significant changes have occurred at all stages of software development. In particular, the initial stages of identifying requirements and modeling processes were the stages that experienced the greatest changes. On the opposite, the technical development phase has not noticeably changed but, nevertheless, it is necessary to look at the importance of training software developers for GDPR rules and practices.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nTwo relevant limitations were identified as follows: only four case studies involving micro-companies and SMEs were considered, and only the traditional software development methodology was considered. The use of agile methodologies was not explored in this study and the findings can only be mainly applied to the waterfall model.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study offers mainly practical contributions by identifying a set of challenges that are posed to software engineering companies by the implementation of GDPR.

Data were gathered qualitatively to answer the study’s research question: How is ISRA practiced on the cloud? The Coat Hanger model was used as a theoretical lens to study and theorize the practices.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results showed that the organizations aimed to follow the guidelines, in the form of frameworks or their own experience, to conduct ISRA; furthermore, the frameworks were altered to fit the organizations’ needs. The results further indicated that one of the main concerns with the cloud ISRA was the absence of a culture that integrates risk management. Finally, the findings also stressed the importance of a good understanding and a well-written legal contract between the cloud providers and the organizations using the cloud services.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nAs opposed to the previous research, which was more inclined to try out and evaluate various cloud ISRA, the study provides insights into the practice of cloud ISRA experienced by the organizations.

Game characteristics refer to features that contribute to a game’s usefulness, interactivity, playfulness or attractiveness. Game context pertains to factors that determine how a game is used, including the target audience, the skill involved and the story. Learning theory explains how learning takes place and can be classified as behaviorism, cognitivism, humanism, social learning or constructivism. User characteristics including gender, age, computer experience, knowledge and perception, are attributes that can impact users’ susceptibility to cybercrimes and hence learning outcomes.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe framework facilitates taking stock of past research and guiding future research.

To apply the BioGames paradigm, the authors developed a BB collection tool for mobile devices named BioGames App. The BioGames App collects keystroke dynamics, touch gestures, and motion modalities and is available on GitHub. Interested researchers and practitioners may use it to create their datasets for research purposes.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nOne major challenge for BB and continuous authentication (CA) research is the lack of actual BB datasets for research purposes. The compilation and refinement of an appropriate set of BB data constitute a challenge and an open problem. The issue is aggravated by the fact that most users are reluctant to participate in long demanding procedures entailed in the collection of research biometric data. As a result, they do not complete the data collection procedure, or they do not complete it correctly. Therefore, the authors propose a new paradigm and introduce a BB collection tool, which they call BioGames, for the extraction of biometric features in a convenient way. The BioGames paradigm proposes a methodology where users play games without participating in an experimental painstaking process. The BioGames App collects keystroke dynamics, touch gestures, and motion modalities.\n\n\nFindings\nThe authors proposed a new paradigm for the collection of BB on mobile devices and created the BioGames application. The BioGames App is an Android application that collects BB data on mobile devices and sends them to a database. The database design allows multiple users to store their sensor data at any time. Thus, there is no concern about data separation and synchronization. BioGames App is General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant as it collects and processes only anonymous data.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe BioGames App is a publicly available tool that combines the keystroke dynamics, touch gestures, and motion modalities.

One of the ways to realise these benefits is to embark on digital transformation initiatives that may be summed up as the intelligent interconnectivity of people, processes, data and cyber-connected things. Sadly, this interconnectivity between the enterprise information technology (IT) and industrial control systems (ICS) environment introduces new attack surfaces for critical infrastructure (CI) operators. As a result of the ICS cybersecurity risk introduced by the interconnectivity between the enterprise IT and ICS networks, the purpose of this study is to identify the cybersecurity capabilities that CI operators must have to attain good cybersecurity resilience.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA scoping literature review of best practice international CI protection frameworks, standards and guidelines were conducted. Similar cybersecurity practices from these frameworks, standards and guidelines were grouped together under a corresponding National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework (CF) practice. Practices that could not be categorised under any of the existing NIST CF practices were considered new insights, and therefore, additions.\n\n\nFindings\nA CI cybersecurity capability framework comprising 29 capability domains (cybersecurity focus areas) was developed as an adaptation of the NIST CF with an added dimension. This added dimension emphasises cloud computing and internet of things (IoT) security. Each of the 29 cybersecurity capability domains is executed through various capabilities (cybersecurity processes and procedures). The study found that each cybersecurity capability can further be operationalised by a set of cybersecurity controls derived from various frameworks, standards and guidelines, such as COBIT®, CIS®, ISA/IEC 62443, ISO/IEC 27002 and NIST Special Publication 800-53.\n\n\nPractical implications\nCI sectors are immediately able to adopt the CI cybersecurity capability framework to evaluate their levels of resilience against cyber-attacks, given new attack surfaces introduced by the interconnectivity of cyber-connected things between the enterprise and ICS levels.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe authors present an added dimension to the NIST framework for CI cyber protection. In addition to emphasising cryptography, IoT and cloud computing security aspects, this added dimension highlights the need for an integrated approach to CI cybersecurity resilience instead of a piecemeal approach.\n",

The problem is caused by the user forgetting or mistyping the password (usually because of character switching). The source of this issue is that while a password containing combinations of lowercase characters, uppercase characters, digits and special characters (LUDS) offers a reasonable level of security, it is complex to type and/or memorise, which prolongs the user authentication process. This results in much time being spent for no benefit (as perceived by users), as the user authentication process is merely a prerequisite for whatever a user intends to accomplish. This study aims to address this issue, passphrases that exclude the LUDS guidelines are proposed.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nTo discover constructs that create security and to investigate usability concerns relating to the memory and typing issues concerning passphrases, this study was guided by three theories as follows: Shannon’s entropy theory was used to assess security, chunking theory to analyse memory issues and the keystroke level model to assess typing issues. These three constructs were then evaluated against passwords and passphrases to determine whether passphrases better address the security and usability issues related to text-based user authentication. A content analysis was performed to identify common password compositions currently used. A login assessment experiment was used to collect data on user authentication and user – system interaction with passwords and passphrases in line with the constructs that have an impact on user authentication issues related to security, memory and typing. User–system interaction data was collected from a purposeful sample size of 112 participants, logging in at least once a day for 10 days. An expert review, which comprised usability and security experts with specific years of industry and/or academic experience, was also used to validate results and conclusions. All the experts were given questions and content to ensure sufficient context was provided and relevant feedback was obtained. A pilot study involving 10 participants (experts in security and/or usability) was performed on the login assessment website and the content was given to the experts beforehand. Both the website and the expert review content was refined after feedback was received from the pilot study.\n\n\nFindings\nIt was concluded that, overall, passphrases better support the user during the user authentication process in terms of security, memory issues and typing issues.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis research aims at promoting the use of a specific type of passphrase instead of complex passwords.

As social media use expands in terms of the number of users and functionality; it is important to understand social media user privacy-protection behaviors and the users’ psychological underpinnings driving those behaviors. Among these, perceptions are the users’ evaluation of their privacy concerns and data sharing benefits inherent in social media use which influence the users’ behaviors to protect their privacy.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nTo research these issues, a theoretical model and hypotheses were developed, based on self-efficacy theory. The theoretical model was empirically tested using 193 questionnaire responses collected from students enrolled in business courses at a medium-sized university in the western USA. All the respondents reported that they routinely use social media. The empirical analysis was performed using structural equations modeling in PC SAS version 9.4, procedure Calis.\n\n\nFindings\nThe estimation of the paths in the structural model indicates that privacy concerns positively influence social media users’ protection behaviors while the perceived benefits of data sharing negatively influence protection behaviors. Privacy experience positively influences privacy concerns. Alternatively, social media use positively influences social media self-efficacy and perceived usefulness, which, in turn, have meaningful influences on data sharing benefits.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nPrevious findings about the effect of self-efficacy on protection behaviors has been inconclusive. This study adds some clarity. Specifically, the findings suggest that the effect depends upon the foci of self-efficacy. While higher self-efficacy with respect to using privacy-related features of a specific technology tends to lead to greater privacy concerns, higher self-efficacy with respect to the more general technology (e.g. social media, computer) seems to affect protection behaviors through perceived benefits. Further, the results of this study offer conclusions about the roles that privacy experiences, social media use and perceived social media benefits play in affecting protection behaviors.\n",

The increasing number of cyber-breaches targeting businesses makes this activity inescapable. Recently, researchers have published comprehensive lists of recommended cyber measures, specifically to inform organisational boards. However, the young cybersecurity industry has still to confirm and refine these guidelines. As a starting point, it would be helpful for organisational leaders to know what other organisations are doing in terms of using these guidelines. In an ideal world, bespoke surveys would be developed to gauge adherence to guidelines, but this is not always feasible. What we often do have is data from existing cybersecurity surveys. The authors argue that such data could be repurposed to quantify adherence to existing information security guidelines, and this paper aims to propose, and test, an original methodology to do so.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe authors propose a quantification mechanism to measure the degree of adherence to a set of published information security governance recommendations and guidelines targeted at organisational leaders. The authors test their quantification mechanism using a data set collected in a survey of 156 Italian companies on information security and privacy.\n\n\nFindings\nThe evaluation of the proposed mechanism appears to align with findings in the literature, indicating the validity of the present approach. An analysis of how different industries rank in terms of their adherence to the selected set of recommendations and guidelines confirms the usability of our repurposed data set to measure adherence.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, a quantification mechanism as the one proposed in this study has never been proposed, and tested, in the literature. It suggests a way to repurpose survey data to determine the extent to which companies are implementing measures recommended by published cybersecurity guidelines.

The authors investigate the effect of various factors of behavioral intention through the new incorporation of a modified technology acceptance model (TAM) and diffusion of innovation theory (DOI). Also, the authors have created a new theoretical framework with constructs such as security and privacy risks (SPR), biometrics privacy concerns (BPC) and perceived risk of using the technology (PROU). In this paper, the authors conducted a structural equation modeling empirical research. This research is designed in such a way to respond to the trade-off between users’ concern for the protection of their biometrics privacy and their protection from risks.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe authors provide an extensive conceptual framework for both existing models (TAM and DOI) and the new constructs that the authors have added to the model. In addition, this research explores external factors, such as trust in technology (TT) and innovativeness (Innov). In addition, the authors have introduced significant constructs, to overcome the limitations of the TAM and to adapt it to the needs of the present research. The new theoretical framework the authors introduce in the present research concerns the constructs SPR, BPC and PROU.\n\n\nFindings\nThe authors found that the main facilitators of behavioral intention to adopt the technology (BI) are TT, followed by compatibility (COMP), perceived usefulness (PU) and Innov. This research also shows that individuals are less interested in the ease of use of the technology and are willing to sacrifice it to achieve greater security. COMP and Innov also play a significant role. Individuals who believe that the usage of the behavioral biometrics continuous authentication (BBCA) technology would fit into their lifestyle and would like to experiment with new technologies have a positive intention to adopt the BBCA technology. The new constructs the authors have added are SPR, BPC and PROU. The authors’ results support the hypotheses that SPR is a facilitator to PU and PU acts as a facilitator to BI. Consequently, the hypothesis that individuals do not feel adequately protected by classical methods will consider the usefulness of the BBCA as a technology for their extra protection against risks is confirmed by the model. Also, with the constructs BPC and PROU, the authors examined if individuals’ concerns regarding their biometrics privacy act as inhibitors in the BI. The authors concluded that individuals consider that the benefits of using BBCA technology are much more important than the risks for their biometrics privacy since the hypothesis that the major inhibitor of BI is PROU is not supported by the model.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is among the first in the field that examines the factors that influence the individuals’ decision to adopt BBCA technology.\n",

Cyberwar games are the highly stylized representation of cyber conflicts in a simulation model. Game models are helpful in understanding the phenomenon of cyber attacks as well as to evolve new techniques of detection. Cyber security trainings are generally very challenging. Cyber test beds make such trainings easy both for trainees and trainers. However, it is not feasible for each organization to build a network for the sole purpose of hands-on training for employees. Therefore, it is desirable to build an interactive environment that is interesting and free of cost as well.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nAfter exploring existing cyberwar games and their techniques, limitation and strengths, this paper presents a design to merge the cyber attacks into a unique model of war game for detection and analysis of malware. This research designs a malware analysis testbed using online free resources. The authors have used the platform of Cyber Defense Technology Experimental Research (DETER). This study proposed model of a testbed that supports malware reverse engineering scenarios, exercise logs and analysis to develop reverse engineering tactics.\n\n\nFindings\nThe proposed cyber testbed is an automated system that can be used as a platform to train cyber warriors. A few features of the proposed testbed are as follows: testbed provides real or seemingly real malware communication with the real world. It includes automated decisions for the detection of malicious behavior without human intervention. The author gives a design to develop free of cost mechanism for remote learning of highly technical cyber security areas, and this simulation is for malware analysis.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nCyberwar games are built for strengthening offensive and defensive capabilities in cyberspace. For this purpose, many simulations, as well as emulation platforms, can be found. Some are free and open-source, whereas others are commercial and quite expensive. Existing testbeds have limitations in respect of cyberwar games for creating innovative scenarios. Existing literature does not offer any attack and response scenario developed for malware detection through some existing open-source and online simulation or emulation environments. This research includes an analysis of the existing platforms as well as the design of a new model for malware analysis and training.\n",

However, if an individual is authenticating under duress, the coerced attempt must be acknowledged and appropriate warnings issued. Furthermore, as duress may entail multiple combinations of emotions, the current f-score evaluation does not accommodate that multiple selected samples possess similar levels of importance. Thus, this study aims to demonstrate an approach to identifying duress within a voice-based authentication system.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nMeasuring the value that a classifier presents is often done using an f-score. However, the f-score does not effectively portray the proposed value when multiple classes could be grouped as one. The f-score also does not provide any information when numerous classes are often incorrectly identified as the other. Therefore, the proposed approach uses the confusion matrix, aggregates the select classes into another matrix and calculates a more precise representation of the selected classifier’s value. The utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through multiple tests and is conducted as follows. The initial tests’ value is presented by an f-score, which does not value the individual emotions. The lack of value is then remedied with further tests, which include a confusion matrix. Final tests are then conducted that aggregate selected emotions within the confusion matrix to present a more precise utility value.\n\n\nFindings\nTwo tests within the set of experiments achieved an f-score difference of 1%, indicating, Mel frequency cepstral coefficient, emotion detection, confusion matrix, multi-layer perceptron, Ryerson audio-visual database of emotional speech and song (RAVDESS), voice authentication that the two tests provided similar value. The confusion matrix used to calculate the f-score indicated that some emotions are often confused, which could all be considered closely related. Although the f-score can represent an accuracy value, these tests’ value is not accurately portrayed when not considering often confused emotions. Deciding which approach to take based on the f-score did not prove beneficial as it did not address the confused emotions. When aggregating the confusion matrix of these two tests based on selected emotions, the newly calculated utility value demonstrated a difference of 4%, indicating that the two tests may not provide a similar value as previously indicated.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis approach’s performance is dependent on the data presented to it. If the classifier is presented with incomplete or degraded data, the results obtained from the classifier will reflect that. Additionally, the grouping of emotions is not based on psychological evidence, and this was purely done to demonstrate the implementation of an aggregated confusion matrix.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe f-score offers a value that represents the classifiers’ ability to classify a class correctly. This paper demonstrates that aggregating a confusion matrix could provide more value than a single f-score in the context of classifying an emotion that could consist of a combination of emotions. This approach can similarly be applied to different combinations of classifiers for the desired effect of extracting a more accurate performance value that a selected classifier presents.\n",

This research aims to build a system that will continuously authenticate the user of a smartphone.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nSession authentication schemes establish the identity of the user only at the beginning of the session, so they are vulnerable to attacks that tamper with communications after the establishment of the authenticated session. Moreover, smartphones themselves are used as authentication means, especially in two-factor authentication schemes, which are often required by several services. Whether the smartphone is in the hands of the legitimate user constitutes a great concern and correspondingly whether the legitimate user is the one who uses the services. In response to these concerns, BBCA technologies have been proposed on a large corpus of literature. This paper presents a research on the development and validation of a BBCA system (named BioPrivacy), which is based on the user’s keystroke dynamics and touch gestures, using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Also, this paper introduces a new BB collection tool and proposes a methodology for the selection of an appropriate set of BB.\n\n\nFindings\nThe system achieved the best results for keystroke dynamics which are 97.18% accuracy, 0.02% equal error rate, 97.2% true acceptance rate and 0.02% false acceptance rate.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper develops a new BB collection tool, named BioPrivacy, by which behavioral data of users on mobile devices can be collected.

Different security tools like intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system and firewalls are available that provide preventive security to the enterprise networks. However, security information and event management (SIEM) systems use these tools in combination to collect events from diverse data sources across the network. SIEM is a proactive tool that processes the events to present a unified security view of the whole network at one location. SIEM system has, therefore, become an essential component of an enterprise network security architecture. However, from various options available, the selection of a suitable and cost-effective open source SIEM solution that can effectively meet most of the security requirements of small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is not simple because of the lack of strong analysis.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn this work, the authors first review the security challenges faced by different SME sectors and then consider a comprehensive comparative analysis of the capabilities of well-known open source SIEM solutions. Based on this, the authors provide requirements based recommendations of open source SIEM solutions for SMEs. This paper aims to provide a valuable resource that can be referred to by SMEs for the selection of a SIEM system best suited to their organization’s security posture.\n\n\nFindings\nSecurity requirements of SMEs vary according to their network infrastructure; therefore, every open source SIEM solution would not be suitable for an SME. Selection of a SIEM solution from available open source solutions based upon the security requirements of an SME network is a critical task. Therefore, in this work, a meaningful insight for the selection of an appropriate SIEM solution for SMEs is provided.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nMajor contribution of this work is the mapping of the security requirements of the SME sectors under consideration, against the open source SIEM options to provide meaningful insight for SMEs in the selection of an appropriate solution.\n",

Considering the high level of mistrust of citizens and businesses toward governmental institutions, the government must ensure the security of the information handled and provided by online users. Results to date have not been adequate in the usage of e-government systems. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the level of online security affects usage and impacts the cost-effectiveness and quality of the operations and, consequently, the operational effectiveness of organizations using e-government systems.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nStructural equation modeling was used to analyze the antecedents and outcomes of operational effectiveness. To this end, 440 usable questionnaires were collected from managers and personnel from Colombian organizations using e-government systems.\n\n\nFindings\nAccording to the findings, there is a positive predictive relationship between online security and the dimensions of electronic government effectiveness. Furthermore, neither online security nor any of the dimensions of electronic government effectiveness affect the operational costs of organizations. Nonetheless, the quality of information has a positive effect on the quality of operations. As a result, through the quality of the information, online security has an indirect impact on the quality of operations.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe authors used a convenience sample, carefully selecting respondents based on their operations and practice knowledge and implementation of online security processes. Besides, compared to previous research conducted in developed nations, the sample size is relatively small. Because the survey is based on responses from official companies, it must also be taken into account that over 50% of Colombian labor is informal. Furthermore, Colombia is a nation with a high level of mistrust. When considering these factors, generalizability to all industrial sectors is questionable. Nevertheless, the findings of this study offer relevant information that indicates the need for more extended and comprehensive quantitative research.\n\n\nPractical implications\nImprovements in organizations that use e-government systems, based on the benefits that high-quality information brings to operational performance – cost and quality – will help them survive and become more sustainable and competitive. Furthermore, this study supports the assertion that aspects like online security are critical in promoting information and communication technology uptake and user acceptance in transition and rising economies like Colombia.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThere is still a scarcity of information on assessing the effectiveness of electronic government systems and their impact on the quality and cost of operations in organizations that use them. Additionally, Colombia, as a country with low levels of trust between citizens, organizations and government, still lacks information about the impact of online security on the effectiveness of its operations.\n",

This paper aims to discuss FinTech and its dynamic changes in the banking sector. This study tests the mediation influence of perceived trust on adoption readiness and intention to use FinTech in India. The proposed impact of mediation of perceived trust was significant but small on adoption readiness and intention to use FinTech.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA questionnaire survey was administered to mobile payment users, and 349 responses were collected. Structural equations are analyzed to determine the proposed variables’ direct effects on adopting them.

The study’s significant findings will enable mobile payment institutions to understand the variables related to the growing use of technology in customers’ contexts. The study reveals the significance of ease of use, perceived usefulness and facilitating the service condition, which means that vendors prefer to use compatible devices that are easy to use with other devices. The analysis also explores the critical influence of perceived usefulness on customer behavior, enabling software designers to encourage accessible processes and device advantages for customers.\n\n\nPractical implications\nMobile payment systems offered by financial institutions until currently become a variety of mobile payment services due to rapidly evolving information technology. This work is a groundbreaking attempt to apply technology acceptance in recent years to the emerging framework of mobile banking systems. This study examines the adoption of mobile payment technologies by proposing an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) to capture the issues associated with adoption in India through banking users.

Statistical software was used to analyse the quantitative data and NVivo software was used to analyse the qualitative data.\n\n\nFindings\nThe pandemic-induced environmental disruption manifested as a sudden shift to work-from-home for employees, and relatedly an increase in cybercrime. The organisational response to this gave rise to shifts in both organisational and information security culture towards greater control (rule and goal orientations) and greater flexibility (support and innovation orientations), most significantly with information security culture flexibility. The net effect was an increase in employee information security compliance.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe vast literature on organisational culture and information security culture was drawn on to theoretically anchor and develop parsimonious measures of information security culture.

Cybersecurity is increasingly a concern for SMEs. Previous literature has explored the role of tools for awareness raising. However, few studies validated the effectiveness and usefulness of cybersecurity tools for SMEs in real-world practices.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study is built on a qualitative approach to investigating how CYSEC is used in SMEs to support awareness raising and capability improvement. CYSEC was placed in operation in 12 SMEs. This study first conducted a survey study and then nine structured interviews with chief executive officers (CEOs) and chief information security officers (CISO).\n\n\nFindings\nThe results emphasise that SMEs are heterogeneous. Thus, one cybersecurity solution may not suit all SMEs. The findings specify that the tool’s adoption varied quite widely. Four factors are primary determinants influencing the adoption of CYSEC: personalisation features, CEOs’ or CISOs’ awareness level, CEOs’ or CISOs’ cybersecurity and IT knowledge and skill and connection to cybersecurity expertise.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis empirical study provides new insights into how a self-paced tool has been used in SMEs. This study advances the understanding of cybersecurity activities in SMEs by studying the adoption of CYSEC. Moreover, this study proposes significant dimensions for future research.\n",

Nations attempt to strike a balance between security and the (expressed or otherwise) privacy needs of citizens. Attacks (physical or cyber) on citizens shift the equilibrium point towards security. In contrast, civil liberties organisations act to preserve or increase privacy. The purpose of this paper is to explore Australian attitudes towards privacy and surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this paper aims to discover what (if any) factors contribute to societal acceptance of privacy encroachment implicated by surveillance programs.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nData collection occurred during 2021 using a cross-sectional survey comprising a variety of self-assessment questions. In addition, anchoring vignettes were introduced as a means of contextualising complex concepts, i.e. privacy and security. Finally, latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify homogenous patterns within the data, referred to as “classes” for the analysis of trust.\n\n\nFindings\nFirst, the survey revealed that citizens appear to be unconcerned about surveillance in public and private spaces (although this may be a temporary effect resulting from the pandemic). The potential for identification, however, does raise concerns. Second, LCA surfaced a specific group that were more likely to trust entities and showed less concern about surveillance in society. Finally, even this latter group displayed a “trust deficit” in specific organisations (private businesses and social media firms).\n\n\nResearch limitations/practical implications\nThe tension between security and privacy remains, even in a post-pandemic world; therefore, the authors consider that the results, whilst interesting, are preliminary. Notwithstanding this, the findings provide insight into Australian attitudes towards privacy and surveillance and, consequently, provide input into public policy.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis is the most recent survey of the Australian public concerning this issue.

For this, the adoption theories and models have been studied. The literature available in this context has also been studied with a focus on security and privacy issues. After the initial study, few hypotheses have been formulated and a conceptual model has been developed. These hypotheses were validated with the help of statistical tools by conducting sample survey with 324 usable responses against 36 questionnaires.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results of this study highlight that of the eight hypotheses conceptually formulated, one hypothesis was not supported as is evident from the application of statistical analysis. This is the influence of perceived ease of use on attitude of the stakeholders intending to use the AI-integrated CRM system in Indian organizations. The results also transpire that the model so provided has achieved 87% explanative power.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe model so provided has taken the help of the technological acceptance model. It has also used the issues circumscribing menace of security and privacy vulnerabilities. Consideration of the technological acceptance model and aspects of issues of security and privacy has enriched the model rendering its explanative power to 87%.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe model is simple. Practitioners can execute this model without having any complexity. The policymakers could also get inputs from the model, as it has focused specially on security and privacy issues that could help to enhance the trust of the potential users.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nNot many studies are found covering the adoption of the AI-integrated CRM system by Indian organizations with a special focus on security and privacy aspects.

A wide and increasing range of different technologies, devices, platforms, applications and services are being used every day by home users. In parallel, home users are also experiencing a range of different online threats and attacks and are increasingly being targeted as they lack the knowledge and awareness about potential threats and how to protect themselves. The increase in technologies and platforms also increases the burden upon a user to understand how to apply security across differing technologies, operating systems and applications. This results in managing the security across their technology portfolio increasingly more troublesome and time consuming. This paper aims to propose an approach that attempts to propose a system for improving security management and awareness for home users.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe proposed system is capable of creating and assigning different security policies for different digital devices in a user-friendly fashion. These assigned policies are monitored, checked and managed to review the user’s compliance with the assigned policies to provide bespoke awareness content based on the user’s current needs.\n\n\nFindings\nA novel framework was proposed for improving information security management and awareness for home users. In addition, a mock-up design was developed to simulate the proposed approach to visualise the main concept and the functions which might be performed when it is deployed in a real environment. A number of different scenarios have been simulated to show how the system can manage and deal with different types of users, devices and threats. In addition, the proposed approach has been evaluated by experts in the research domain. The overall feedback is positive, constructive and encouraging. The experts agreed that the identified research problem is a real problem. In addition, they agreed that the proposed approach is usable, feasible and effective in improving security management and awareness for home users.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe proposed design of the system is a mock-up design without real data. Therefore, implementing the proposed approach in a real environment can provide the researcher with a better understanding of the effectiveness and the functionality of the proposed approach.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThis study offers a framework and usable mock-up design which can help in improving information security management for home users.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nImproving the security management and awareness for home users by monitoring, checking and managing different security controls and configurations effectively are the key to strengthen information security. Therefore, when home users have a good level of security management and awareness, this could protect and secure the home network and subsequently business infrastructure and services as well.\n",

Organizations are adopting mobile technologies for various business applications including ES to increase the flexibility and to gain sustainable competitive advantage. At the same time, end-users are exposed to security issues when using mobile technologies. The ES have seen breaches and malicious intrusions thereby more sophisticated recreational and commercial cybercrimes have been witnessed. ES have seen data breaches and malicious intrusions leading to more sophisticated cybercrimes. Considering the significance of security in ES mobility, the research questions in this study are: What are the security issues of ES mobility? What are the influences of users’ attitude towards those security issues? What is the impact of users’ attitude towards security issues on perceived security of ES mobility?\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThese questions are addressed by empirically testing a security model of mobile ES by collecting data from users of ES mobile systems. Hypotheses were evolved and tested by data collected through a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire survey was administered to 331 users from Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). The data was statistically analysed by tools such as correlation, factor analysis, regression and the study built a structural equation model (SEM) to examine the interactions between the variables.\n\n\nFindings\nThe study results have identified the following security issues: users’ attitude towards mobile device security issues; users’ attitude towards wireless network security issues; users’ attitude towards cloud computing security issues; users’ attitude towards application-level security issues; users’ attitude towards data (access) level security issues; and users’ attitude towards enterprise-level security issues.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe study results are based on a sample of users from Chinese SMEs. The findings may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to examine the model in a different context. The issues requiring further investigation are the role of gender and type of device on perceived security of ES mobile systems.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe results show that the key security issues are related to a mobile device, wireless network, cloud computing, applications, data and enterprise. By understanding these issues and the best practices, organizations can maintain a high level of security of their mobile ES.\n\n\nSocial implications\nApart from understanding the best practices and the key issues, the authors suggest management and end-users to work collaboratively to achieve a high level of security of the mobile ES.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis is an empirical study conducted from the users’ perspective for validating the set of research hypotheses related to key security issues on the perceived security of mobile ES.\n",

The proposed method draws on established standards, such as the ISO/IEC 27002 and information classification practices.

The empirical demonstration shows that senior and novice information security managers perceive the method as a useful tool for classifying information assets in an organisation.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nExisting research has, to a limited extent, provided extensive advice on how to approach information classification in organisations systematically.

They also demonstrate that privacy concerns do not seem to affect the amount of information users choose to publish when shaping their digital identity. Specific characteristics of SNS platforms are found to affect the way that users shape their digital identity and their privacy behavior.

However, this view has changed in recent years and people are no longer seen only as a problem, but also as part of the solution. In research, this change is reflected in the fact that people are enabled to report security incidents that they have detected. During this reporting process, however, it is important to ensure that the reports are submitted with the highest possible data quality. This paper aims to provide a process-driven quality improvement approach for human-as-a-security-sensor information. This work builds upon existing approaches for structured reporting of security incidents. In the first step, relevant data quality dimensions and influencing factors are defined. Based on this, an approach for quality improvement is proposed. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, it is prototypically implemented and evaluated using an exemplary use case. In this paper, a process-driven approach is proposed, which allows improving the data quality by analyzing the similarity of incidents. It is shown that this approach is feasible and leads to better data quality with real-world data. The originality of the approach lies in the fact that data quality is already improved during the reporting of an incident. In addition, approaches from other areas, such as recommender systems, are applied innovatively to the area of the human-as-a-security-sensor.",

The scope of information security has widened as information has become a critical supply chain asset, making it more important to protect the organization’s data. Today’s global supply chains rely upon the speedy and robust dissemination of information among supply chain partners. Hence, processing of accurate supply chain information is quintessential to ensure the robustness and performance of supply chains. An effective information security management (ISM) is deemed to ensure the robustness of supply chains. The purpose of the paper is to examine the impact of information security initiatives on supply chain robustness and performance.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nBased on extant literature, a research model was developed and validated using a questionnaire survey instrument administered among information systems/information technology managers. Data collected were analyzed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Further, to test the hypotheses and to fit the theoretical model, Structural equation modeling techniques were used.\n\n\nFindings\nResults of this study indicated that information security initiatives are positively associated with supply chain robustness and performance. These initiatives are likely to enhance the robustness and performance of the supply chains.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nWith the advancements in internet technologies and capabilities as well as considering the dynamic environment of supply chains, this study is relevant in terms of the capability that an organization needs to acquire with regards to ISM. Benefiting from the resource dependency theory, information security initiatives could be considered as a critical resource having an influence on the internal and external environment of supply chains.\n",

Intangible assets allow us to gauge the data breach’s impact on the organization’s brand reputation and intellectual capital reserves. Extraordinary losses allow us to gauge if organizations considered data breaches truly detrimental to their operations that they rose to the level of “extraordinary” and not an event that could be incorporated into its usual operating expenses.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study uses a matched sample comparison analysis of 47 organizations to understand the short-term and long-term impacts of data breach events on an organization’s financial performance.\n\n\nFindings\nData breach events have some negative impacts on the organization’s profitability more than likely leading to a depletion of the organization’s assets.

With children increasingly operating as independent agents online, their teachers and carers need to understand the risks of their new playground and the range of risk management strategies they can deploy. Carers and teachers play a prominent role in applying the three M’s: mentoring the child, mitigating harms using a variety of technologies (where possible), and monitoring the child’s online activities to ensure their cybersecurity and cybersafety. In this space, the core concepts of ‘cybersafety’ and ‘cybersecurity’ are substantively different, and this should be acknowledged for the full range of counter-measures to be appreciated. Evidence of core concept conflation emerged, confirming the need for a resource pack to improve comprehension. A carefully crafted resource pack was developed to convey knowledge of risky behaviours for three age groups, and mapped to the appropriate “three M’s” to be used as counter-measures. The investigation revealed key concept conflation, then identified a wide range of harms and countermeasures. The resource pack brings clarity to this domain for all stakeholders. The number of people who were involved in the empirical investigation were limited to those living in Scotland and Nigeria, but it is unlikely that the situation is different elsewhere, because the Internet is global and children’s risky behaviours are likely to be similar across the globe. Others have investigated this domain but no one, to our knowledge, has come up with the \"Three M's\" formulation and a visualisation-based resource pack that can inform educators and carers in terms of actions they can take to address the harms.",

Yet, in the privacy context, the evidence is far from conclusive suggesting that strong and as-yet unmeasured influences on behaviour may exist. This paper aims to demonstrate one such link – the effect of internet addiction on information disclosure.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nData from 216 Web users was collected regarding their perceptions on privacy and information disclosure intentions as well as avoidance behaviour, an element of internet addiction. Using a research model based on the Privacy Calculus theory, structural equation modelling was applied to quantify the determinants of online disclosure under various conditions.\n\n\nFindings\nThe authors show that not all aspects of privacy (a multi-dimensional construct) influence information disclosure. While concerns about data collection influence self-disclosure behaviour, the level of awareness about privacy does not. They next examine the impact of internet addiction on these relationships, finding that internet addiction weakens the influence of privacy concerns to the point of non-significance.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe authors highlight some of the influences of self-disclosure behaviour, showing that some but not all aspects of privacy are influential. They also demonstrate that there are powerful influences on user behaviour that have not been accounted for in prior work; internet addiction is one of these factors.

Passwords, being essentially sequences of alphanumeric characters, make it likely that dyslexics will struggle with these, even more so than the rest of the population. Here, this study explores the difficulties people with dyslexia face, their general experiences with passwords, the coping strategies they use and the advice they can provide to developers and others who struggle with passwords.

This mutual trade-off needs to be considered and addressed whenever security products are developed. Achieving well-balanced levels of both is a precondition for sufficient security as users tend to reject unusable solutions. To assess it correctly, usability should be evaluated in the context of security. This paper aims to identify and describe universally applicable and solution-independent factors that affect the perceived usability of security mechanisms.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe selected methodology was a systematic literature review during which multiple database resources were queried. Application of predefined selection criteria led to the creation of a bibliography before backward snowballing was applied to minimize the risk of missing material of importance. All 70 included publications were then analyzed through thematic analysis.\n\n\nFindings\nThe study resulted in the identification of 14 themes and 30 associated subthemes representing aspects with reported influence on perceived usability in the context of security. While some of them were only mentioned sparsely, the most prominent and thus presumably most significant ones were: simplicity, information and support, task completion time, error rates and error management.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe identified novel themes can increase knowledge about factors that influence usability. This can be useful for different groups: end users may be empowered to choose appropriate solutions more consciously, developers may be able to avoid common usability pitfalls when designing new products and system administrators may benefit from a better understanding of how to configure solutions and how to educate users efficiently.\n",

Taxonomy of aware/unaware vs active/passive cybersecurity footprints are presented, followed by brief discussion of the implications for future research.\n\n\nFindings\nThe concept of cybersecurity footprint is defined, and the evidence from prior cyber incidents is shown to emphasize the concept. Smaller organizations may have a large cybersecurity footprint, whereas larger organizations may have smaller one. Cyberattacks are focusing on the individuals or small organizations that are in the supply chain of larger organizations causing the domino effect.\n\n\nPractical implications\nImplications of cybersecurity footprint to individuals, organizations, societies and governments are discussed. The authors present organizations with ways to lower cybersecurity footprint along with recommendations for future research.\n\n\nSocial implications\nCybersecurity has a significant social implication worldwide, as the world is becoming cyber dependent. With the authors’ introduction of the cybersecurity footprint concept and call to further understand how organizations can measure and reduce it, the authors envision it as another perspective of assessing cyber risk and further help mitigate future cyber incidents.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper extends the existing information and computer security body of knowledge on the concept of cybersecurity footprint with illustrated cases.\n",

Three significant differences were identified, namely, Generation-Y being significantly more positive than Generation-X regarding privacy control assessment. Also, that the contractor/vendor group was significantly more positive than permanent employees regarding organisational commitment and privacy control assessment. Exploratory factor analysis was used to validate the IPGQ and four factors were identified: privacy control assessment, personal information awareness assessment, privacy governance reporting and organisational commitment towards privacy. Cronbach’s alpha was used to establish the internal reliability of the factors and indicated good internal consistency.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nOne of the potential empirical research limitations for this study is that the study was conducted in a single organisation; therefore, when generalising the results, caution must be taken.\n\n\nPractical implications\nOrganisations, academics and the industry may find the questionnaire useful to determine employee perception towards privacy governance and to identify recommendations that could be used to improve their privacy policies, privacy programme controls and organisational commitment towards privacy. In this study, it was identified that for Generation-X employees to be more accepting towards the privacy controls, the organisation needs to implement focussed awareness training for them. To ensure permanent employees’ commitment and accountability, internal audits, monitoring and risk assessment measures need to be implemented. These can be directed through the outcomes of the survey.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe IPGQ can aid organisations in determining if they are governing privacy effectively, and thus assist them in meeting the accountability condition of data protection regulation.\n",

This paper aims to propose a model that is intended to provide a comprehensive framework for raising the level of compliance amongst end-users, with the aim of monitoring, measuring and responding to users’ behaviour with an information security policy.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe proposed model is based on two main concepts: a taxonomy of the response strategy to non-compliant behaviour and a compliance points system. The response taxonomy comprises two categories: awareness raising and enforcement of the security policy. The compliance points system is used to reward compliant behaviour and penalise non-compliant behaviour.\n\n\nFindings\nA prototype system has been developed to simulate the proposed model and work as a real system that responds to the behaviour of users (reflecting both violations and compliance behaviour). In addition, the model has been evaluated by interviewing experts from academic and industry. They considered the proposed model to offers a novel approach for managing end users’ behaviour with the information security policies.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nPsychological factors were out of the research scope at this stage. The proposed model may have some psychological impacts upon users; therefore, this issue needs to be considered by studying the potential impacts and the best solutions.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nUsers being compliant with the information security policies of their organisation is the key to strengthen information security.

The conceptual model includes four variables: security concerns, perceived risk of cyberattacks, perceived government cybersecurity preparedness and e-services avoidance. Data from 774 participants were used to analyze our conceptual model.\n\n\nFindings\nFirst, the findings show that security concerns regarding personal information safety and perceived risk of cyberattacks are barriers to e-services use, with the former having a stronger effect. Second, the findings showed that perceived government cybersecurity preparedness significantly reduces security concerns and perceived risk of cyberattacks. Third, the post hoc group analysis between individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher versus those without a bachelor’s degree showed that the effect of both security concerns and perceived risk of cyberattacks on e-services avoidance was greater for individuals without a bachelor’s degree. The same relationship between perceived risk of cyberattacks and e-services avoidance was not supported for individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nExtant privacy research fails to adequately examine the role of institutional factors, such as government efforts, and how these mitigate or amplify cybersecurity concerns and risks related to e-services.

One organization that involved investor and treasury services was selected as a case study in this research. A mixed method of data collection, specifically survey questionnaires and observations, was used.FindingsThis study revealed that employees are aware of the policy to protect customer data in their organization. Ironically, customer data theft still occurred despite the company having an internal control system. The main concern was the attitude of the employees to adhere to the policies in place, which becomes the major cause of internal control violation. Employees tend to ignore policies and standard operating procedures, providing opportunities for data theft and fraud to occur, although they realize this will result in a severe impact on the reputation of a company.Research limitations/implicationsThe results provide further confirmation of the fraud triangle theory, i.e. opportunity on the possible causes of the data theft and fraud, supporting prior empirical research and surveys conducted by researchers and global professional firms on fraud.

Security assurance behaviour represents employees’ intentional and effortful actions aimed towards protecting information systems. The behaviour is highly desired as it tackles the human factor within the information security framework. The authors posited that security assurance behaviour is a learned behaviour that can be enhanced by the implementation of information security monitoring.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nTheoretical framework underlying this study with six constructs, namely, subjective norm, outcome expectation, information security monitoring, information security policy, self-efficacy and perceived inconvenience, were identified as significant in determining employees’ security assurance behaviour (SAB). The influence of these constructs on SAB could be explained by social cognitive theory and is empirically supported by past studies. An online questionnaire survey as the main research instrument is adopted to elicit information on the six constructs tested in this study. Opinion from industry and academic expert panels on the relevance and face validity of the questionnaire were obtained prior to the survey administration.\n\n\nFindings\nFindings from this research indicate that organisations will benefit from information security monitoring by encouraging security behaviours that extend beyond the security policy. This study also demonstrates that employees tend to abandon security behaviour when the behaviour is perceived as inconvenient. Hence, organisations must find ways to reduce the perceived inconvenience using various security automation methods and specialised security training. Reducing perceived inconvenience is a challenge to information security practitioners.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThere are some limitations in the existing work that could be addressed in future studies. One of them is the possible social desirability bias due to the self-reported measure adopted in the study. Even though the authors have made every effort possible to collect representative responses via anonymous survey, it is still possible that the respondents may not reveal true behaviour as good conduct is generally desired. This may lead to a bias towards favourable behaviour.\n\n\nPractical implications\nIn general, the present research provides a number of significant insights and valuable information related to security assurance behaviour among employees. The major findings could assist security experts and organisations to develop better strategies and policies for information security protection. Findings of this research also indicate that organisations will benefit from information security monitoring by encouraging security behaviours that extend beyond the security policy.\n\n\nSocial implications\nIn this research, the social cognitive learning theory is used to explain the influence of information security monitoring and other social learning factors on employees’ security assurance behaviour; the finding implies that monitoring emphases expected behaviours and helps to reinforce organisational norms. Monitoring may also accelerate learning when employees become strongly mindful of their behaviours. Hence, it is important for organisations to communicate the monitoring practices implemented, even more imperative whenever security monitoring employed is unobtrusive in nature. Nonetheless, care must be taken in this communication to avoid resentment and mistrust among employees.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study is significant in a number of ways. First, this study highlights significant antecedents of security assurance behaviour, which helps organisations to assess their current practices, which may nurture or suppress information security. Second, using users’ perspective, this study provides recommendations pertaining to monitoring as a form of information security measure. Third, this study provides theoretical contribution to the existing information security literature via the application of the social cognitive learning theory.\n",

This culminates in the equal emphasis of both the social, technical and environmental factors affecting security practices.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe socio-technical systems theory was used to develop a conceptual process model for analysing organisational practices in terms of their social, technical and environmental influence. The conceptual process model was then applied to specifically analyse some selected information and cybersecurity frameworks. The outcome of this exercise culminated in the design of a socio-technical systems cybersecurity framework that can be applied to any new or existing information and cybersecurity solutions in the organisation. A framework parameter to help continuously monitor the mutual alignment of the social, technical and environmental dimensions of the socio-technical systems cybersecurity framework was also introduced.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results indicate a positive application of the socio-technical systems theory to the information and cybersecurity domain. In particular, the application of the conceptual process model is able to successfully categorise the selected information and cybersecurity practices into either social, technical or environmental practices. However, the validation of the socio-technical systems cybersecurity framework requires time and continuous monitoring in a real-life environment.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThis research is beneficial to chief security officers, risk managers, information technology managers, security professionals and academics. They will gain more knowledge and understanding about the need to highlight the equal importance of both the social, technical and environmental dimensions of information and cybersecurity. Further, the less emphasised dimension is posited to open an equal but mutual security vulnerability gap as the more emphasised dimension. Both dimensions must, therefore, equally and jointly be emphasised for optimal security performance in the organisation.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe application of socio-technical systems theory to the information and cybersecurity domain has not received much attention.

This programme is based on existing research and provides a unique insight into an ongoing city-based project with similar aims.Design/methodology/approachTo structure this work, a scoping review was conducted of the literature in cybersecurity education and awareness, particularly for SMEs/SMBs. This theoretical analysis was complemented using a case study and reflecting on an ongoing, innovative programme that seeks to work with these businesses to significantly enhance their security posture. From these analyses, best practices and important lessons/recommendations to produce a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness were recommended.FindingsWhile the literature can be informative at guiding education and awareness programmes, it may not always reach real-world programmes. However, existing programmes, such as the one explored in this study, have great potential, but there can be room for improvement. Knowledge from each of these areas can, and should, be combined to the benefit of the academic and practitioner communities.Originality/valueThe study contributes to current research through the outline of a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness targeting SMEs/SMBs.

Because of the ever-increasing digitalisation and coupling between the cyber and physical world, security has become an additional concern in these industries. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate how well bow-tie analysis performs in the context of security, and the study’s hypothesis is that the bow-tie notation has a suitable expressiveness for security and safety.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a formal, controlled quasi-experiment on two sample populations – security experts and security graduate students – working on the same case. As a basis for comparison, the authors used a similar experiment with misuse case analysis, a well-known technique for graphical security modelling.FindingsThe results show that the collective group of graduate students, inexperienced in security modelling, perform similarly as security experts in a well-defined scope and familiar target system/situation. The students showed great creativity, covering most of the same threats and consequences as the experts identified and discovering additional ones. One notable difference was that these naïve professionals tend to focus on preventive barriers, leading to requirements for risk mitigation or avoidance, while experienced professionals seem to balance this more with reactive barriers and requirements for incident management.Originality/valueOur results are useful in areas where we need to evaluate safety and security concerns together, especially for domains that have experience in health, safety and environmental hazards, but now need to expand this with cybersecurity as well.",

Although penetration testing has traditionally focussed on technical aspects, the field has started to realise the importance of the human in the organisation, and the need to ensure that humans are resistant to cyberattacks.

In a previous paper, the authors reported on PoinTER (Prepare TEst Remediate), a human pentesting framework, tailored to the needs of SMEs. This paper aims to propose improvements to refine the framework. The improvements are based on a derived set of ethical principles that have been subjected to ethical scrutinyDesign/methodology/approachThe authors conducted a systematic literature review of academic research, a review of actual hacker techniques, industry recommendations and official body advice related to social engineering techniques. To meet the requirements to have an ethical human pentesting framework, the authors compiled a list of ethical principles from the research literature which they used to filter out techniques deemed unethical.FindingsDrawing on social engineering techniques from academic research, reported by the hacker community, industry recommendations and official body advice and subjecting each technique to ethical inspection, using a comprehensive list of ethical principles, the authors propose the refined GDPR-compliant and privacy respecting PoinTER framework.

In cloud computing, data processing is delegated to a remote party for efficiency and flexibility reasons. A practical user requirement usually is data privacy; hence, the confidentiality and integrity of data processing needs to be protected. In the common scenarios of cloud computing today, this can only be achieved by assuming that the remote party does not in any form act maliciously.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nAn approach that avoids having to trust a single entity is proposed. This approach is based on two concepts: the technical abstraction of sealed computation, i.e. a technical mechanism to confine a privacy-aware processing of data within a tamper-proof hardware container, and the role of an auditing party that itself cannot add functionality to the system but is able to check whether the system (including the mechanism for sealed computation) works as expected.\n\n\nFindings\nDiscussion and analysis of the abstract, technical and procedural requirements of these concepts and how they can be applied in practice are explained.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nA preliminary version of this paper was published in the proceedings of the second International Workshop on SECurity and Privacy Requirements Engineering (SECPRE, 2018).\n",

The proposed scheme will be implemented in this work by defining the complete scheme for representing an email, which is more expressive than the standard one defined for STIX, designed specifically for spam email analysis.\n\n\nFindings\nMoreover, the paper provides a new scheme for general DSA representation that has been practically applied for the process of encoding specific attributes in different CTI reports.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nBecause of the chosen approach, the research results may have limitations. Specifically, current practice for entity recognition has the limitation that was discovered during the research. However, its effect on process time was minimized and the way for improvement was proposed.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper has covered the existing gap including the lack of generality in DSA representation for privacy-preserving analysis of structured CTI. Therefore, the new model for DSA representation was introduced, as well as its practical implementation.\n",

In fact, fertilizers and pesticides play a crucial role in agriculture, representing a powerful tool for growers to increase yield and guarantee continuous productivity throughout the seasons under both optimal and suboptimal conditions. In the last three decades, several technological innovations have been proposed to enhance the sustainability of agricultural production systems, through a significant reduction of synthetic agrochemicals like pesticides and fertilizers. A promising and environmental-friendly innovation would be the use of natural plant biostimulants (PBs) that enhance flowering, plant growth, fruit set, crop productivity, and nutrient use efficiency (NUE), and are able also to improve the tolerance against a wide range of abiotic stressors (Colla and Rouphael, 2015). PBs were initially defined by excluding some functionalities like fertilizers or plant protection products. In 1997, in Grounds Maintenance web-journal, Zhang and Schmidt from the Department of Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, defined PBs as “materials that, in minute quantities, promote plant growth”. By using the statement “minute quantities” for describing PBs, the authors implicitly wanted to discriminate biostimulants from nutrients and soil amendments, which also promote plant growth, but are clearly applied in larger quantities. The PBs mentioned in this web article were two important categories such as humic acids and seaweed extracts, and their action on plants was proposed to be essentially hormonal. In 2012, the European Commission has assigned an ad hoc study on plant biostimulants to evaluate the substances and materials involved, which was published by du Jardin (2012) as: “The Science of Plant Biostimulants A bibliographic Analysis”. Based on the scientific literature (250 scientific articles using the term ‘biostimulant' in their titles and/or abstracts), the following definition was proposed: “Plant biostimulants are substances and materials, with the exception of nutrients and pesticides, which, when applied to plant, seeds or growing substrates in specific formulations, have the capacity to modify physiological processes of plants in a way that provides potential benefits to growth, development and/or stress responses”. du Jardin (2012) concluded that PBs are very heterogeneous materials, and proposed in his study eight categories of substances that acts as biostimulants: humic substances, complex organic materials (obtained from agro-industrial and urban waste products, sewage sludge extracts, composts, and manure), beneficial chemical elements (Al, Co, Na, Se, and Si), inorganic salts including phosphite, seaweed extracts (brown, red, and green",

The proposed IDS model must possess the following characteristics: combine a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate, and classify any connection in a specific category of network connection. , – To build the binary tree, the authors cluster the different categories of network connections hierarchically based on the proportion of false-positives and false-negatives generated between each of the two categories. The built model is a binary tree with multi-levels. At first, the authors use the best classifier in the classification of the network connections in category A and category G2 that clusters the rest of the categories. Then, in the second level, they use the best classifier in the classification of G2 network connections in category B and category G3 that represents the different categories clustered in G2 without category B. This process is repeated until the last two categories of network connections. Note that one of these categories represents the normal connection, and the rest represent the different types of abnormal connections. , – The experimentation on the labeled data set for flow-based intrusion detection, NSL-KDD and KDD’99 shows the high performance of the authors' model compared to the results obtained by some well-known classifiers and recent IDS models. The experiments’ results show that the authors' model gives a low false alarm rate and the highest detection rate. Moreover, the model is more accurate than some well-known classifiers like SVM, C4.5 decision tree, MLP neural network and naive Bayes with accuracy equal to 83.26 per cent on NSL-KDD and equal to 99.92 per cent on the labeled data set for flow-based intrusion detection. As well, it is more accurate than the best of related works and recent IDS models with accuracy equal to 95.72 per cent on KDD’99. , – This paper proposes a novel hierarchical IDS based on a binary tree of classifiers, where different types of classifiers are used to create a high-performance model.

Developing organizational security governance (OSG) objectives pose significant challenges for organizations considering the ever-increasing vulnerability from lack of or misuse of appropriate controls. In recent years, there have been several cases of colossal losses to businesses due to inadequate security governance measure. In many cases, organizations do not even know as to what their ISG objectives might be. Following an extensive empirical study, this paper proposes 6 fundamental and 17 means objectives for designing security governance. The objectives were developed from individual values of information technology and security executives across a wide range of firms. The study comprised 52 interview respondents across 9 firms, which resulted in 23 OSG objectives. Theoretically, the study was grounded in Catton’s (1959) value theory and Keeney’s (1992...",

Attack graphs have been proposed as a viable solution to many problems in computer network security management. After individual vulnerabilities are identified with a vulnerability scanner, an attack graph can relate the individual vulnerabilities to the possibility of an attack and subsequently analyze and predict which privileges attackers could obtain through multi-step attacks (in which multiple vulnerabilities are exploited in sequence). , – The attack graph tool, MulVAL, was fed information from the vulnerability scanner Nexpose and network topology information from 8 fictitious organizations containing 199 machines. Two teams of attackers attempted to infiltrate these networks over the course of two days and reported which machines they compromised and which attack paths they attempted to use. Their reports are compared to the predictions of the attack graph analysis. , – The prediction accuracy of the attack graph analysis was poor. Attackers were more than three times likely to compromise a host predicted as impossible to compromise compared to a host that was predicted as possible to compromise. Furthermore, 29 per cent of the hosts predicted as impossible to compromise were compromised during the two days. The inaccuracy of the vulnerability scanner and MulVAL’s interpretation of vulnerability information are primary reasons for the poor prediction accuracy. , – Although considerable research contributions have been made to the development of attack graphs, and several analysis methods have been proposed using attack graphs, the extant literature does not describe any tests of their accuracy under realistic conditions.",

Then, structural equation modelling was utilised to test the final model of the theory and to assess the overall goodness-of-fit between the proposed model and the collected data set. , – The first study, as a qualitative exploratory study, gives a rich data set that provides the foundation of the development of the second study, as a quantitative confirmatory study. In the researcher’s previous qualitative study, it provides a better theoretical understanding of the potential threat of cyber and conventional terrorism to Saudi national security.

Anonymous credential proofs are integrated into the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) protocol and the approach is evaluated in a real-world Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) environment. , – The results of this work indicate that it is possible to create VoIP CAPTCHA services offering privacy-preserving, user-centric challenges while maintaining sufficient efficiency. , – The proposed approach was evaluated through an experimental implementation to demonstrate its feasibility. Additional features, such as appropriate user interfaces and efficiency optimisations, would be useful for a commercial product. Security measures to protect the system from attacks against the SIP protocol would be useful to counteract the effects of the introduced overhead. Future research could investigate the use of this approach on non-audio CAPTCHA services. , – PrivCAPTCHA is expected to achieve fairer, non-discriminating CAPTCHA services while protecting the user’s privacy. Adoption success relies upon the general need for employment of privacy-preserving practices in electronic interactions. , – This approach is expected to enhance the quality of life of users, who will now receive CAPTCHA challenges closer to their characteristics. This applies especially to users with disabilities. Additionally, as a privacy-preserving service, this approach is expected to increase trust during the use of services that use it. , – To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first comprehensive proposal for privacy-preserving CAPTCHA challenge adaptation. The proposed system aims at providing an improved CAPTCHA service that is more appropriate for and trusted by human users.",

The overall success of an information security system depends on analysis of the risks and threats so that appropriate protection mechanism can be in place to protect them. However, lack of appropriate analysis of risks may potentially results in failure of information security systems.

Although passwords serve as the first authentication factor, a common approach to implementing the second factor is sending a one-time code, either via e-mail or text message. The prevalence of smartphones, however, creates security risks in which a stolen phone leads to user’s accounts being accessed. Physical tokens such as RSA’s SecurID create extra burdens for users and cannot be used on many accounts at once. This study aims to improve the usability and security for two-factor online authentication. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe authors propose a novel second authentication factor that, similar to passwords, is also based on something the user knows but operates similarly to a one-time code for security purposes. The authors design this component to provide higher security guarantee with minimal memory burden and does not require any additional communication channels or hardware. Motivated by psychology research, the authors leverage users’ autobiographical memory in a novel way to create a secure and memorable component for two-factor authentication. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nIn a multi-session lab study, all of the participants were able to log in successfully on the first attempt after a one-week delay from registration and reported satisfaction on the usability of the scheme. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThe results indicate that the proposed approach to leverage autobiographical memory is a promising direction for further research on second authentication factor based on something the user knows.",

The examination is focused on the question of whether these practices are both useful and practical when used within very large organizations.,The author identifies a number of information security management practices that are considered to be “best practice” in the general case but that are suboptimal at the margin represented by very large organizations. A number of alternative management practices are proposed that compensate for the identified weaknesses.,Quoting from the conclusion of the paper: We have seen in our analysis within this paper that some best practices can experience what economists refer to as diminishing marginal utility. As the target organization drifts from the typical use-case the amount of value-added declines and can potentially enter negative territory.

After conducting model validation, the hypotheses were tested using multiple linear regression.,The results of the study revealed that procedural justice, distributive justice, severity and celerity of sanction, privacy, responsibility and organizational security culture were significant predictors of violations of information security measures. Only interactional justice was not significant.,As with any exploratory case study, this research has limitations such as the self-reported information and the method of measuring the violation of information security measures. The method of measuring information security violations has been a challenge for researchers. Of course, the best method is to capture the actual behavior. Another limitation to this case study which might have affected the results is the significant number of faculty members in the respondent pool. The shared governance culture of faculty members on a US university campus might bias the results more than in a company environment. Caution should be applied when generalizing the results of this case study.,The findings validate past research and should encourage managers to ensure employees are involved with developing and implementing information security measures. Additionally, the information security measures should be applied consistently and in a timely manner. Past research has focused more on the certainty and severity of sanctions and not as much on the celerity or swiftness of applying sanctions. The results of this research indicate there is a need to be timely (swift) in applying sanctions. The importance of information security should be grounded in company culture. Employees should have a strong sense of treating company data as they would want their own data to be treated.,Engaging employees in developing and implementing information security measures will reduce employees’ violations. Additionally, giving employees the assurance that all are given the same treatment when it comes to applying sanctions will reduce the violations.,Setting and enforcing in a timely manner a solid sanction system will help in preventing information security violations. Moreover, creating a culture that fosters information security will help in positively affecting the employees’ perceptions toward privacy and responsibility, which in turn, impacts information security violations.

The advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial technology (FinTech) innovation. Financial sectors and startups see FinTech as a gateway to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms must be launched to explore such opportunities. Mobile application security threats have increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and FinTech innovators. In this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the expectations of both users and organizations to adopt FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, user interface design and FinTech promotion. The empirical results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. Existing studies have used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to address this issue. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity.,In this paper, the authors empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and organizations in adopting FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the user design interface and FinTech promotion.

This research proposes a model called “Intention to adopt FinTech in Germany,” constructs of which were developed based on the TAM and five additional components, as identified. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity.,The authors demonstrated that the number of mobile users in Germany is rapidly increasing; yet the adoption of FinTech is extremely sluggish. It is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile devices, but only 10 per cent recognized FinTech. Further, it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used FinTech services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents. It is obvious that the FinTech incubators and banks offering FinTech services need to persuade their customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of FinTech. This study has been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke FinTech adoption.,There are a few limitations in this study. Initially, this study focuses on FinTech implementation in Germany and not the whole of Europe. In addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect their particular impact on the intention to use FinTech services, particularly among younger users with a high interest in technology. Without these constraints, the authors could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to further upgrade polices to enhance the FinTech adoption process. Future analysts can assist exploration of this topic by altering determinants in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. Additionally, because the cluster sampling technique was used, the reported outcomes are not 100 per cent generalized to the German population. To accomplish a complete generalization, a basic random sampling strategy for the whole population is essential. The authors could also alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to FinTech to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies.,This study was conducted in Germany and might have produced different results if held in other countries, as technology acceptance is different in a different environment. For instance, the authors suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in the United Kingdom, where take-up of FinTech appears to be far greater than in Germany. Therefore, the authors’ results are only generalized for the country of Germany and not other geographical areas. Furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about FinTech usage which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions. In spite of this, this study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and FinTech services experience. The authors also neglected social impact and control factors, as their corresponding items disregarded the instrument dependability. Accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and control factors on FinTech use.,The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to accomplish economies of scale for global intensity. The authors do hope that this paper will serve to encourage FinTech innovators in their approach to FinTech and enable FinTech researchers to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement in the future.,A considerable amount of revenue has been invested in the information technology (IT) infrastructure of banks to enhance their performance, but investment in IT remains a substantial risk regarding the return on investment (Carlson, 2015). Most banks and financial organizations around the globe are engaging in an extreme pressure from their customers and competitors to enhance IT.",

Pre-tests, pre-study, main study and a follow-up study compose the frame of our methodology where more than 500 respondents are involved across different organizations.FindingsThe results confirm that the antecedents that explain the escalation of commitment behavior in terms of the effect of lost assets, such as time, effort and other resources, give us a new lens to understand noncompliance behavior; employees seem to escalate their commitments to the completion of their tasks at the expense of becoming noncompliant with ISP.Research limitations/implicationsOne of the key areas that requires further attention from this study is to better understand the role of risk perceptions on employee behavior when dealing with value conflicts. Depending on how risk-averse or risk seeking an employee is, the model showed no significant support in either case to influence their noncompliance behavior. The authors therefore argue that employees' noncompliance may be influenced by more powerful beliefs, such as self-justification and sunk costs.Practical implicationsThe results show that when employees are caught in tasks undergoing difficulties, they are more likely to increase noncompliance behavior. By understanding better how project obstacles result in such tasks, security managers can define new mechanisms to counter employees’ shift from compliance to noncompliance.Social implicationsApart from encouraging compliance with enforcement mechanisms (using direct behavioral controls like sanctions or rewards), indirect behavior controls may also encourage compliance. The authors suggest that the ISPs should state that the organization would take positive actions toward task completion and help their employees to resolve their problems quickly.Originality/valueThis study is the first to tackle escalation of commitment theories and use antecedents that explain the effect of lost assets, such as time, effort and other resources can also explain noncompliance with ISP in terms of the value conflicts, where employees would often choose to forego compliance at the expense of finishing their tasks.",

In addition, it was tested to what extent the model relations are equivalent across fear appeal conditions and across time.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA pre-test post-test design was used. In the pre-test, 1,201 internet users filled out an online survey and were presented with one of three fear appeal conditions: strong fear appeal, weak fear appeal and control condition. Arguments regarding vulnerability of phishing attacks and response efficacy of vigilant online information-sharing behaviour were manipulated in the fear appeals. In the post-test, data were collected from 786 internet users and analysed with partial least squares path modelling.\n\nFindings\nThe study found that PMT model relations hold in the domain of phishing. Self-efficacy and fear were the most important predictors of protection motivation. In general, the model results were equivalent across conditions and across time.\n\nPractical Implications\nIt is important to consider online information-sharing behaviour because it facilitates the occurrence and success of phishing attacks. The results give practitioners more insight into important factors to address in the design of preventative measures to reduce the success of phishing attacks. Future research is needed to test how fear appeals work in real-world settings and over longer periods.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper is a substantial adaptation of a previous conference paper (Jansen and Van Schaik, 2017a, b).\n",

The study examined the effect of resilience and job stress on the three components that comprise ISA, namely, knowledge, attitude and behaviour.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA total of 1,048 working Australians completed an online questionnaire. ISA was measured with the Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire. Participants also completed the Brief Resilience Scale and the Job Stress Scale.\n\nFindings\nIt was found that participants with greater resilience also had higher ISA and experienced lower levels of job stress. More specifically, individuals who reported higher levels of resilience had significantly better knowledge, attitude and behaviour. Similarly, participants who reported lower levels of job stress also reported significantly better knowledge, attitude and behaviour. Resilience plays an important mediating role in the relationship between job stress and ISA. This means that even if people have high levels of job stress, if they are better able to cope with or adapt to stress (i.e. have higher resilience), they are less likely to have lower ISA. Results of this study add to the body of literature emphasising the positive effects of resilience and suggest that resilience is associated with improved ISA and therefore more secure behaviour.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nFuture research should focus on assessing the influence of resilience training in the workplace.\n\nOriginality/value\nGiven the constructive findings, it may be valuable to focus on the effect of organisational culture, and organisational security culture, on resilience, job stress and ISA.\n",

This paper aims to explore the effect of personality trait variations (through the Big Five Inventory [BFI]) on users’ risk level of their intended security behaviors. In addition, age, gender, service usage and information technology (IT) proficiency are analyzed to identify what role and impact they have on behavior.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe authors developed a quantitative-oriented survey that was implemented online. The bi-variate Pearson two-tailed correlation was used to analyze survey responses.\n\nFindings\nThe results obtained by analyzing 538 survey responses suggest that personality traits do play a significant role in affecting users’ security behavior risk levels. Furthermore, the results suggest that BFI score of a trait has a significant effect as users’ online personality is linked to their offline personality, especially in the conscientiousness personality trait. Additionally, this effect was stronger when personality was correlated with the factors of IT proficiency, gender, age and online activity.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, with the aid of a large population sample, end-users’ security practice is assessed from multiple domains, and relationships were found between end-users’ risk-taking behavior and nine user-centric factors. Second, based upon these findings, the predictive ability for these user-centric factors were evaluated to determine the level of risk a user is subject to from an individual behavior perspective. Of 28 behaviors, 11 were found to have a 60 per cent or greater predictive ability, with the highest classification of 92 per cent for several behaviors. This provides a basis for organizations to use behavioral intent alongside personality traits and demographics to understand and, therefore, manage the human aspects of risk.\n",

                    "abstract": "\nPurpose\nNowadays, to operate securely and legally and to achieve business objectives, secure valuable assets and support uninterrupted business processes, all organizations need to match a lot of internal and external compliance regulations such as laws, standards, guidelines, policies, specifications and procedures. An integrated system able to manage information security (IS) for their intranets in the new cyberspace while processing tremendous amounts of IS-related data coming in various formats is required as never before. These data, after being collected and analyzed, should be evaluated in real-time from an IS incident viewpoint, to identify an incident’s source, consider its type, weigh its consequences, visualize its vector, associate all target systems, prioritize countermeasures and offer mitigation solutions with weighted impact relevance. Different security information and event management (SIEM) systems cope with this routine and usually complicated work by rapid detection of IS incidents and further appropriate response. Modern challenges dictate the need to build these systems using advanced technologies such as the blockchain (BC) technologies (BCTs). The purpose of this study is to design a new BC-based SIEM 3.0 system and propose a methodology for its evaluation.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nModern challenges dictate the need to build these systems using advanced technologies such as the BC technologies. Many internet resources argue that the BCT suits the intrusion detection objectives very well, but they do not mention how to implement it.\n\n\nFindings\nAfter a brief analysis of the BC concept and the evolution of SIEM systems, this paper presents the main ideas on designing the next-generation BC-based SIEM 3.0 systems, for the first time in open access publications, including a convolution method for solving the scalability issue for ever-growing BC size. This new approach makes it possible not to simply modify SIEM systems in an evolutionary manner, but to bring their next generation to a qualitatively new and higher level of IS event management in the future.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe most important area of the future work is to bring this proposed system to life. The implementation, deployment and testing onto a real-world network would also allow people to see its viability or show that a more sophisticated model should be worked out. After developing the design basics, we are ready to determine the directions of the most promising studies. What are the main criteria and principles, according to which the organization will select events from PEL for creating one BC block? What is the optimal number of nodes in the organization’s BC, depending on its network assets, services provided and the number of events that occur in its network? How to build and host the SIEM 3.0 BC infrastructure? How to arrange streaming analytics of block’s content containing events taking place in the network? How to design the BC middleware as software that enables staff to interact with BC blocks to provide services like IS events correlation? How to visualize the results obtained to find insights and patterns in historical BC data for better IS management? How to predict the emergence of IS events in the future? This list of questions can be continued indefinitely for a full-fledged design of SIEM 3.0.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThis paper shows the full applicability of the BC concept to the creation of the next-generation SIEM 3.0 systems that are designed to detect IS incidents in a modern, fully interconnected organization’s network environment. The authors’ attempt to begin with a detailed description of the basics for a BC-based SIEM 3.0 system design is presented, as well as the evaluation methodology for the resulting product.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe authors believe that their new revolutionary approach makes it possible not to simply modify SIEM systems in an evolutionary manner, but to bring their next generation to a qualitatively new and higher level of IS event management in the future. They hope that this paper will evoke a lively response in this segment of the security controls market from both theorists and direct developers of living systems that will implement the above approach.\n",

Financial institutions often use their websites as part of their online awareness and education efforts. This paper aims to explore the effectiveness of phishing-related information made available by financial institutions to raise awareness and educate customers.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn this mixed methods research, a survey of online consumers was first performed and analysed. Second, the information available on the websites of major financial institutions was analysed. Using the construct of information quality (IQ), content analysis was performed to determine whether the phishing-related information meets the IQ criteria.\n\n\nFindings\nThe survey confirmed that consumers are indeed targeted by phishers. It established that they turn to their financial institutions, more often than any other source, for anti-phishing information. When analysing the IQ of phishing-related information, significant deficiencies as well as different levels of performance between the financial institutions, emerged. In general, the worst performing IQ criteria was information being current and fit for purpose.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nAs the research is conducted within South Africa, the results cannot be generalised. The ethical clearance did not allow for identification of the different financial institutions and thus comparing consumers’ perceptions with the observed IQ from the content analysis to determine correlation.\n\n\nPractical implications\nProtecting consumers against phishing attacks remains critical, and this paper confirms that users turn to their financial institutions for information. Yet, the phishing-related information made available on the websites of financial institutions has severe deficiencies. Practitioners should use IQ to determine the appropriateness of phishing-related information and focus on improving customer awareness and education.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nResearchers often highlight the importance of awareness and education programmes in protecting consumers, but rarely investigate if consumers access publicly available information and express an opinion on the quality of this information.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how work-related groups influence information security policy compliance intentions and to what extent this influence is captured by the Theory of Planned Behavior, an established model over individual decision-making.Design/methodology/approachA multilevel model is used to test the influence of work-related groups using a cluster sample of responses from 2,291 employees from 203 worksites, 119 organizations, 6 industries and 38 professions.FindingsThe results suggest that work-related groups influence individuals’ decision-making in the manner in which contemporary theories of information security culture posit. However, the influence is weak to modest and overshadowed by individual perceptions that are straightforward to measure.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper is limited to one national culture and four types of work-related groups. However, the results suggest that the Theory of Planned Behavior captures most of the influence that work-related groups have on decision-making. Future research on security culture and similar phenomena should take this into account.Practical implicationsInformation security perceptions in work-related groups are diverse and information security decisions appear to be based on individual perceptions and priorities rather than groupthink or peer-pressure.

The ISCA diagnostic instrument statements are also presented in this paper. The ISCCM approach using ISCA is illustrated using data from an empirical study.,The ISCCM approach was found to be useful in defining change management interventions for organisations using the data of the ISCA survey. Employees’ perception and acceptance of change to ensure information security and the effectiveness of the information security training initiatives improved significantly from the as-is survey to the follow-up survey.,The research illustrates the ISCCM approach and shows how it should be combined with the ISCA diagnostic instrument. Future research will focus on including a qualitative assessment of information security culture to complement the empirical data.,Organisations do not have to rely on or adapt organisational development approaches to change their information security culture – they can use the proposed ISCCM approach, which has been customised from information security and change management approaches, together with the presented ISCA questionnaire, to address information security culture change purposefully.,The proposed ISCCM approach can be applied to complement existing information security management approaches through a holistic and structured approach that combines the ADKAR model, Prosci’s approach of change management and the ISCA diagnostic instrument.

In this dynamic and heterogeneous setting, the purpose of this paper is to present a methodology called opportunity-enabled risk management (OPPRIM), which supports the decision-making process in access control to remote corporate assets.,OPPRIM relies on a logic-based risk policy model combining estimations of trust, threats and opportunities. Moreover, it is based on a mobile client – server architecture, where the OPPRIM application running on the user device interacts with the company IT security server to manage every access request to corporate assets.,As a mandatory requirement in the highly flexible BYOD setting, in the OPPRIM approach, mobile device security risks are identified automatically and dynamically depending on the specific environment in which the access request is issued and on the previous history of events.,The main novelty of the OPPRIM approach is the combined treatment of threats (resp., opportunities) and costs (resp., benefits) in a trust-based setting. The OPPRIM system is validated with respect to an economic perspective: cost-benefit sensitivity analysis is conducted through formal methods using the PRISM model checker and through agent-based simulations using the Anylogic framework.",

Decisions regarding the use of cloud computing in organizations bring these responsibilities to the fore. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe design of this paper is based on an extensive review of literature, predominantly best practices and standards, from the fields covering IT governance, cloud computing and assurance. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThe results from this paper can be used to formulate cloud computing assurance evidence statements, as part of IT governance mandates. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThis paper aims to add value by highlighting the responsibility of managers to ensure assurance when exploiting opportunities presented through IT advances, such as cloud computing; serving to inform management about the advances that have and are being made in the field of cloud computing guidelines; and motivating that these guidelines be used for assurance on behalf of organizations adopting and using cloud computing.",

The models are: protection motivation theory (PMT), the reasoned action approach (RAA) and an integrated model comprising variables of these models. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nData were collected from 1,200 Dutch users of online banking by means of an online survey and analysed using partial least squares path modelling method. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThe two models equally explain about much of the variance in precautionary online behaviour; in the integrated model, the significant predictors of the two models remained significant. Precautionary online behaviour is largely driven by response efficacy, attitude towards behaviour and self-efficacy. \n \n \n \n \nResearch limitations/implications \n \n \n \n \nOne limitation is that the predictor variables – “self-efficacy” and “attitude” – are represented by one item only in the path-analysis because of high cross-loadings of the other items with the dependent variable. \n \n \n \n \nPractical implications \n \n \n \n \nThe results give practitioners a potentially wider range of options to design preventative measures. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThe three models are successfully applied to online banking.

Both studies used a Qualtrics-based questionnaire that was distributed via an email link. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThe results showed that the average level of ISA among bank employees was consistently 20 per cent higher than that among general workforce participants in all focus areas and overall. There were no significant differences between the ISA scores for those who received more frequent training compared to those who received less frequent training. This result suggests that the frequency of training is not a contributing factor to an employee’s level of ISA. \n \n \n \n \nResearch limitations/implications \n \n \n \n \nThis current research did not investigate the information security (InfoSec) culture that prevailed within the bank in question because the objective of the research was to compare a bank’s employees with general workforce employees rather than compare organisations.

This would form the basis of an adaptive control framework that would complement many of the current international standards, such as ISO’s 27000 series, NIST’s SP800 series and ISACA’s COBIT5.",

SSM is a suitable approach for such analysis within large organisations.,This study demonstrates how important benefits can be obtained by using SSM alongside traditional risk assessment approaches to identify holistic security issues. A holistic approach is particularly important given the increasing complexity of the security threat surface. Banking was selected as a case study because it is both critical to society and is a prime target for attack.

                    "abstract": "Purpose \n \n \n \n \nCyberspace is a virtual environment where instantaneous communications are initiated and consumed using computer networks without any natural or artificial boundaries. These communications are not only an exchange of information but also a catharsis on the socio-political environment of the real world. This explosion of electronic expression is often detrimental to the traditional secretive maneuvers of nation states and the exercise of its power. Unable to come to terms with the new reality nation states through legislative action or otherwise attempt to assert its sovereignty in the space that has no political and societal boundaries. This may lead to an encroachment on basic human rights that often have constitutional guarantees in the real world but may be violated in the online milieu. This paper aims to investigate this issue in detail and evaluate whether nation states are using cyber-security as a propaganda tool to transgress on electronic expression. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe Website of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights states “In December 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 68/167, which expresses deep concern at the negative impact that surveillance and interception of communications may have on human rights”. It further says “The General Assembly called on all States to review their procedures, practices and legislation related to communications surveillance, interception and collection of personal data and emphasized the need for States to ensure the full and effective implementation of their obligations under international human rights law”. With this development, this paper seeks to unravel the role of nation states in using cybersecurity as a propaganda tool by raising the specter of threat to national security and economic wellbeing. The paper is based on exploratory research with data compilation from secondary sources. To collect data, various research papers, books and journals have been referenced and data available in public domain has been accumulated. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThis paper has tried to unravel state action on cyberspace which often runs counter to the concept of civil liberties. It indicates that in terms of both national security and economic impact, cybercrime represent a very nominal threat vector. Also, cybercrime as compared with other forms of crime is again nominal. Finally, cyber laws and policies of different countries need to be more nuanced such as to allow space for civil liberties. Overall, the propaganda surrounding the malaise of cybercrime seems to be more hype than real. We already have examples of countries who have transgressed into electronic expression in cyber space. Therefore, UN has a valid reason to raise a red flag on this unfolding issue. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThis paper was published at 21st Americas Conference of Information Systems held at Puerto Rico, USA, between August 13-15, 2015 (AMCIS, 2015).

This paper aims to present and explain a list of human-centered guidelines for developing usable authentication schemes. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThe guidelines stem from research findings within the fields of psychology, human–computer interaction and information/computer science. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nInstead of viewing users as the inevitable weak point in the authentication process, this study proposes that authentication interfaces be designed to take advantage of users’ natural abilities. This approach requires that one understands how interactions with authentication interfaces can be improved and what human capabilities can be exploited. A list of six guidelines that designers ought to consider when developing a new usable authentication scheme has been presented. \n \n \n \n \nResearch limitations/implications \n \n \n \n \nThis consolidated list of usable authentication guidelines provides system developers with immediate access to common design issues impacting usability.

However, the greatest weakness of many systems is the user. It is argued that authentication schemes with poor usability are inherently insecure, as users will inadvertently weaken the security in their efforts to use the system. The study proposes that designers need to consider the human factors that impact end-user behavior. Development from this perspective will address the greatest weakness in most security systems by increasing end-user compliance.",

During the software development life cycle, non-production environments are used to serve various purposes to include unit, component, integration, system, user acceptance, performance and configuration testing. Organisations and third parties have been and are continuing to use copies of production data in non-production environments. This can lead to personal and sensitive data being accidentally leaked if appropriate and rigorous security guidelines are not implemented. This paper aims to propose a comprehensive framework for minimising data leakage from non-production environments. The framework was evaluated using guided interviews and was proven effective in helping organisation manage sensitive data in non-production environments. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nAuthors conducted a thorough literature review on areas related to data leakage from non-production systems. By doing an analysis of advice, guidelines and frameworks that aims at finding a practical solution for selecting and implementing a de-identification solution of sensitive data, the authors managed to highlight the importance of all areas related to sensitive data protection. Based on these areas, a framework was proposed which was evaluated by conducting set of guided interviews. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThis paper has researched the background information and produced a framework for an organisation to manage sensitive data in its non-production environments. This paper presents a proposed framework that describes a process flow from the legal and regulatory requirements to data treatment and protection, gained through understanding the organisation’s business, the production system, the purpose and the requirements of the non-production environment. The paper shows that there is some conflict between security and perceived usability, which may be addressed by challenging the perceptions of usability or identifying the compromise required. Non-production environments need not be the sole responsibility of the IT section, they should be of interest to the business area that is responsible for the data held. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThis paper proposes a simplified business model and framework. The proposed model diagrammatically describes the interactions of elements affecting the organisation. It highlights how non-production environments may be perceived as separate from the business systems, but despite the perceptions, these are still subject to the same legal requirements and constraints. It shows the interdependency of data, software, technical infrastructure and human interaction and how the change of one element may affect the others. The proposed framework describes the process flow and forms a practical solution in assisting the decision-making process and providing documentary evidence for assurance and audit purposes. It looks at the requirements of the non-production system in relation to the legal and regulatory constraints, as well as the organisational requirements and business systems. The impact of human factors on the data is also considered to bring a holistic approach to the protection of non-production environments.",

Thus, these issues need to be addressed efficiently, especially in organizations in which data are a valuable asset.,Before developing the instrument for the survey, first, effective measurement built upon existing literature review was identified and developed and the survey questionnaires were set according to past studies and the findings based on qualitative analyses. Data were collected by using cross-sectional questionnaire and a Likert scale, whereby each question was related to an item as in the work of Witherspoon et al. (2013). Data analysis was done using the SPSS.3B.,Based on the results from three surveys and findings, a principle of information security compliance practices was proposed based on the authors’ proposed nine-five-circle (NFC) principle that enhances information security management by identifying human conduct and IT security-related issues regarding the aspect of information security management. Furthermore, the authors’ principle has enabled closing the gap between technology and humans in this study by proving that the factors in the present study’s finding are interrelated and work together, rather than on their own.,The main objective of this study was to address the lack of research evidence on what mobilizes and influences information security management development and implementation. This objective has been fulfilled by surveying, collecting and analyzing data and by giving an account of the attributes that hinder information security management. Accordingly, a major practical contribution of the present research is the empirical data it provides that enable obtaining a bigger picture and precise information about the real issues that cause information security management shortcomings.,In this sense, despite the fact that this study has limitations concerning the development of a diagnostic tool, it is obviously the main procedure for the measurements of a framework to assess information security compliance policies in the organizations surveyed.,The present study’s discoveries recommend in actuality that using flexible tools that can be scoped to meet individual organizational needs have positive effects on the implementation of information security management policies within an organization. Accordingly, the research proposes that organizations should forsake the oversimplified generalized guidelines that neglect the verification of the difference in information security requirements in various organizations. Instead, they should focus on the issue of how to sustain and enhance their organization’s compliance through a dynamic compliance process that involves awareness of the compliance regulation, controlling integration and closing gaps.,The rapid growth of information technology (IT) has created numerous business opportunities. At the same time, this growth has increased information security risk. IT security risk is an important issue in industrial sectors, and in organizations that are innovating owing to globalization or changes in organizational culture. Previously, technology-associated risk assessments focused on various technology factors, but as of the early twenty-first century, the most important issue identified in technology risk studies is the human factor.",
