                    "abstract": "The concept of using location information to implicitly unlock smartphones is being widely commercialized on Android phones: once a user registers a location that she is willing to trust, her phone would unlock automatically when the user physically moves to that trusted location. To date, however, security risks associated with misuse of locations to unlock phones (e.g., people registering unsafe locations) have not been studied before. To bridge this gap, we conducted an interview study with 18 participants to study users’ perceptions on the location-based smartphone authentication, and identified key design requirements such as the need to support fine-grained indoor location registration. We then conducted a field study with 29 participants to study real-world usage behaviors with a fully working application that we implemented. Our findings suggest that people often register non-private (potentially unsafe) locations as trusted locations, and select large (phone unlock) coverage areas without considering security implications. As for usability benefits, however, the participants were able to reduce about 37% of manual unlock attempts on average by using our location-based implicit authentication service.",

In this paper, we explore the usage of blocklists to improve the security of user-chosen patterns by disallowing common patterns, a feature currently unavailable on Android but used by Apple during PIN selection. In a user study run on participants’ smartphones (n = 1006), we tested 5 different blocklist sizes and compared them to a control treatment. We find that even the smallest blocklist (12 patterns) had benefits, reducing a simulated attacker’s success rate after 30 guesses from 24 % to 20 %. The largest blocklist (581 patterns) reduced the percentage of correctly guessed patterns after 30 attempts down to only 2 %. In terms of usability, blocklists had limited negative impact on shortterm recall rates and entry times, with reported SUS values indicating reasonable usability when selecting patterns in the presence of a blocklist. Based on our simulated attacker performance results for different blocklist sizes, we recommend blocking 100 patterns for a good balance between usability and security.",

                    "abstract": "The FIDO2 standard aims to replace passwords with publickey cryptography for user authentication on the web. Doing so has benefits for both usability (e.g., not needing to remember passwords) and security (e.g., eliminating phishing). Users can authenticate with FIDO2 in one of two ways. With platform authenticators, users authenticate to trusted hardware on the same device on which they are accessing a website. However, they must re-register for each website separately on each device. With roaming authenticators, such as USB security keys, they only need to register once, transferring the security key across devices. However, users might not be willing to pay for a USB security key, carry it around, or figure out how to plug it into different devices. These drawbacks have driven recent efforts to enable smartphones to serve as roaming authenticators. We conducted the first user study of FIDO2 passwordless authentication using smartphones as roaming authenticators. In a between-subjects design, 97 participants used either their smartphone as a FIDO2 roaming authenticator (via a prototype called Neo) or a password to log into a fictitious bank for two weeks. We found that participants accurately recognized Neo’s strong security benefits over passwords. However, despite Neo’s conceptual usability benefits, participants found Neo substantially less usable than passwords both in objective measures (e.g., timing to accomplish tasks) and in perception. Their critiques of Neo included concerns about phone availability, account recovery/backup, and setup difficulties. Our results highlight key challenges and opportunities for spurring adoption of smartphones as FIDO2 roaming authenticators. Copyright is held by the author/owner.

The privacy implications of such apps have been discussed both in academic circles and the general population. The discussion in Germany focused on the trade-off between a centralized or decentralized approach for data collection and processing and their implications. Specifically, privacy dominated the public debate about the proposed “Corona-Warn-App.” This paper presents a study with a quota sample of the German population (n = 744) to assess what the population knew about the soon-to-be-released app and their willingness to use it. We also presented participants potential properties the app could have and asked them how these would affect their usage intention. Based on our findings, we discuss our participants' views on privacy and functionality, including their perception of selected centralized and decentralized features. We also examine a wide range of false beliefs and information that was not communicated successfully. Especially technical details, such as that the app would use Bluetooth, as opposed to location services, were unknown to many participants. Our results give insights on the complicated relationship of trust in the government and public communication on the population's willingness to adopt the app. © is held by the author/owner.

We found that users report interest in seeking information, trust the developers but do little to protect their data.

We ex-tended this study to explore its effect on 23 participants with technical backgrounds, given that misconceptions amongst this group could have important organisational impacts or could inﬂuence other non-technical end users. Our qualitative analysis reveals that technical participants sourced their mental models from both their academic or professional lives and from different forms of media (like news, cinema, forums, and social media). They were capable of identifying unrealistic depictions of hacking in the provided video clips and most could offer simplistic explanations about why these were problematic.

This can put deep insights into users’ private lives into the hands of strangers, and often happens without users’ awareness or explicit consent. EU and UK data protection law, however, requires consent, both 1) to access and store information on users’ devices and 2) to legitimate the processing of personal data as part of third-party tracking, as we analyse in this paper. This paper further investigates whether and to what extent consent is implemented in mobile apps. First, we analyse a representative sample of apps from the Google Play Store. We find that most apps engage in third-party tracking, but few obtained consent before doing so, indicating potentially widespread violations of EU and UK privacy law. Second, we examine the most common third-party tracking libraries in detail. While most acknowledge that they rely on app developers to obtain consent on their behalf, they typically fail to put in place robust measures to ensure this: disclosure of consent requirements is limited; default consent implementations are lacking; and compliance guidance is difficult to find, hard to read, and poorly maintained.",

What if PVIs could transfer task-based visual CAPTCHAs to a helper to solve? How might PVIs want such a system configured in terms of from whom they would solicit help and how they would compensate this help? To answer these questions, we implemented and evaluated a proof-of-concept assistive transfer system — WEBALLY — that makes task-based CAPTCHAs transferable by allowing PVIs to source justin-time, remote control help from a trusted contact. In an exploratory, role-play study with 10 pairs of participants — a PVI and a friend or a family member — we asked participants to use WEBALLY in four different configurations that varied in source of help (friend vs. stranger) and compensation (paid vs. volunteer). We found that PVIs liked having WEBALLY as an additional option for solving visual CAPTCHAs, when other options that preserve their independence fail. In addition, many PVIs and their friends felt that using the system would bring their relationship closer.

Previous approaches on anti-phishing measures have started to recognize the role of the user, who, at the center of the target, builds the last line of defense. However, user-oriented phishing interventions are fragmented across a diverse research landscape, which has not been systematized to date. This makes it challenging to gain an overview of the various approaches taken by prior works. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of phishing interventions based on a systematic literature analysis. We shed light on the diversity of existing approaches by analyzing them with respect to the intervention type, the addressed phishing attack vector, the time at which the intervention takes place, and the required user interaction. Furthermore, we highlight shortcomings and challenges emerging from both our literature sample and prior meta-analyses, and discuss them in the light of current movements in the field of usable security.

The quality of this account remediation advice is of paramount importance in assisting victims of account compromise, yet it is unclear if this advice is complete or suitable. In this paper, we analyze account remediation advice from 57 popular U.S.based web services. We identify five key phases of account remediation, use this five-phase model to develop a codebook of account remediation advice, then analyze topic coverage. We find that only 39% of the web services studied provided advice for all phases of account remediation. We also find that highly-ranked websites and sites with a previously disclosed data breach have more complete coverage than other sites. Our findings show that account remediation should be more carefully and systematically considered by service providers, security researchers, and consumer advocates, and our detailed analysis will aid in creating better guidelines for users and services.",

We therefore tested a new methodology for security developer studies. In an online study, we asked freelance developers to write code reviews for password-storage code snippets. Since developers often tend to focus on functionality first and security later, similar to end users, we prompted half the participants for security. Although the freelancers indicated that they feel responsible for security, our results showed that they did not focus on security in their code reviews, even in a securitycritical task such as password-storage. Almost half the participants wanted to release the insecure code snippets. However, we found that security prompting had a significant effect on the security awareness.

Although messengers like WhatsApp and Signal bring E2E encryption to a broad audience, past work has documented misconceptions of their security and privacy properties. Through a series of five online studies with 683 total participants, we investigated whether making an app’s E2E encryption more visible improves perceptions of trust, security, and privacy. We first investigated why participants use particular messaging tools, validating a prior finding that many users mistakenly think SMS and e-mail are more secure than E2E-encrypted messengers. We then studied the effect of making E2E encryption more visible in a messaging app. We compared six different text disclosures, three different icons, and three different animations of the encryption process. We found that simple text disclosures that messages are “encrypted” are sufficient. Surprisingly, the icons negatively impacted perceptions. While qualitative responses to the animations showed they successfully conveyed and emphasized “security” and “encryption,” the animations did not significantly impact participants’ quantitative perceptions of the overall trustworthiness, security, and privacy of E2E-encrypted messaging. We confirmed and unpacked this result through a validation study, finding that user perceptions depend more on preconceived expectations and an app’s reputation than visualizations of security mechanisms.",

We aim to understand the sources of misconceptions that result in risks to personal data. Through a survey (n=131), we measure where the old devices end up and how they are sanitized. Our survey shows that while most users dispose of their devices, a large proportion of participants (73%) kept at least one old device, often due to data leakage concerns. Among disposed-of devices, 25% of participants reported using methods to erase their data that are insecure. To further explore the processes that were undertaken to sanitize devices and sources of misconception, we invite a subset of respondents (n=35) for interviews. Our interviews uncover the reasons for poor device sanitizing practices—misleading data deletion interfaces and prompts, lack of knowledge, and complex and slow disk wiping procedures. We provide suggestions for device manufacturers and retailers on how to improve privacy, trust, and convenience when sanitizing old devices.",

Therefore, we explore the design space for future authentication mechanisms. We conducted semi-structured interviews with N = 16 Alexa-users incorporating four high-risk scenarios. Using these scenarios, we explored perceived risks, mitigation strategies, and design-aspects to create secure experiences. Among other things, we found that participants are primarily concerned about eavesdropping bystanders, do not trust voicebased PINs, and would prefer trustworthy voice recognition. Our results also suggest that they have context-dependent (location and bystanders) requirements for smart home assistant authentication.

MAR apps are highly dependent on real time context-speciﬁc information provided by the different sensors and data processing capabilities of smartphones (e.g., LiDAR, gyroscope or object recognition). This dependency raises crucial privacy issues for end users. We evaluate whether the existing access permission systems, initially developed for non-AR apps, as well as proposed new permissions, relevant for MAR apps, provide sufﬁcient and clear information to the users. We address this research goal in two online survey-based experiments with a total of 581 participants. Based on our results, we argue that it is neces-sary to increase transparency about MAR apps’ data practices by requesting users’ permissions to access certain novel and privacy invasive resources and functionalities commonly used in MAR apps, such as speech and face recognition. We also ﬁnd that adding justiﬁcations, contextualized to the data collection practices of the app, improves transparency and can mitigate privacy concerns, at least in the context of data utilized to the users’ beneﬁt. Better understanding of the app’s practices and lower concerns, in turn, increase the intentions to grant permissions. We provide recommendations for better transparency in MAR apps.",

Framing and nudging have been shown to impact users’ choices about privacy, we anticipate that they have a similar impact on choices made by developers. We conducted a survey-based online experiment with 400 participants with experience in mobile app development. Across six conditions, we varied the choice framing of options around ad personalization. Participants in the condition where privacy consequences of ads personalization are highlighted in the options are significantly (11.06 times) more likely to choose non-personalized ads compared to participants in the Control condition with no information about privacy.

A PhD student in computer science with prior training in qualitative research methods was embedded in the company for eight months. The researcher joined the company as a software engineer and participated in all development activities as a new hire would, while also making observations on the development practices. During the fieldwork, we observed a positive shift in the development team’s practices regarding secure development. Our analysis of data indicates that the shift can be attributed to enabling all software engineers to see how security knowledge could be applied to the specific software products they worked on. We also observed that by working with other developers to apply security knowledge under the concrete context where the software products were built, developers who possessed security expertise and wanted to push for more secure development practices (security advocates) could be effective in achieving this goal. Our data point to an interactive learning process where software engineers in a development team acquire knowledge, apply it in practice, and contribute to the team, leading to the creation of a set of preferred practices, or “culture” of the team. This learning process can be understood through the lens of the situated learning framework, where it is recognized that knowledge transfer happens within a community of practice, and applying the knowledge is the key in individuals (software engineers) acquiring it and the community (development team) embodying such knowledge in its practice.

The problem of how to perform student assessment in an online environment has become increasingly relevant, leading many institutions and educators to turn to online proctoring services to administer remote exams. These services employ various student monitoring methods to curb cheating, including restricted (“lockdown”) browser modes, video/screen monitoring, local network traffic analysis, and eye tracking. In this paper, we explore the security and privacy perceptions of the student test-takers being proctored. We analyze user reviews of proctoring services' browser extensions and subsequently perform an online survey (n = 102). Our findings indicate that participants are concerned about both the amount and the personal nature of the information shared with the exam proctoring companies. However, many participants also recognize a trade-off between pandemic safety concerns and the arguably invasive means by which proctoring services ensure exam integrity. Our findings also suggest that institutional power dynamics and students' trust in their institutions may dissuade students' opposition to remote proctoring. © is held by the author/owner.

                    "abstract": "Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused people around the world to exercise social distancing, which has led to an abrupt rise in the adoption of remote communications for working, socializing, and learning from home. As remote communications will outlast the pandemic, it is crucial to protect users' security and respect their privacy in this unprecedented setting, and that requires a thorough understanding of their behaviors, attitudes, and concerns toward various aspects of remote communications. To this end, we conducted an online study with 220 worldwide Prolific participants. We found that privacy and security are among the most frequently mentioned factors impacting participants' attitude and comfort level with conferencing tools and meeting locations. Open-ended responses revealed that most participants lacked autonomy when choosing conferencing tools or using microphone/webcam in their remote meetings, which in several cases contradicted their personal privacy and security preferences. Based on our findings, we distill several recommendations on how employers, educators, and tool developers can inform and empower users to make privacy-protective decisions when engaging in remote communications. © is held by the author/owner.

In this work, we report the results of a qualitative study accompanying the deployment of FIDO2-enabled security tokens for primary authentication in a web application of a small software company operating in the life sciences industry. We assisted the company in implementing and setting up FIDO2-enabled authentication on its public test and evaluation server. Over four weeks, we observed the authentication routine of 8 employees out of 10 employees regularly using the web application, including sales representatives, software developers, project managers, and account managers. We gathered data through login diaries, server logs, and semistructured interviews to assess themes regarding usability, perceived security, and deployability. We found that participants had several concerns, like losing the security token and longer authentication times, while the security benefits were largely intangible or perceived as unnecessary.",

While a lesser used authentication method, as compared to PINs or Android patterns, there is likely a large number of Knock Code users; we estimate, 700,000--2,500,000 in the US alone. In this paper, we studied Knock Codes security asking participants to select codes on mobile devices in three settings: a control treatment, a blocklist treatment, and a treatment with a larger, 2x3 grid. We find that Knock Codes are significantly weaker than other deployed authentication, e.g., PINs or Android patterns. In a simulated attacker setting, 2x3 grids offered no additional security, but blocklisting was more beneficial, making Knock Codes' security similar to Android patterns. Participants expressed positive perceptions of Knock Codes, but usability was challenged. SUS values were \"marginal\" or \"ok\" across treatments. Based on these findings, we recommend deploying blacklists for selecting a Knock Code because it improves security but has limited impact on usability perceptions.",

                    "abstract": "We examined the authentication procedures used by ﬁve prepaid wireless carriers when a customer attempted to change their SIM card. These procedures are an important line of defense against attackers who seek to hijack victims’ phone numbers by posing as the victim and calling the carrier to request that service be transferred to a SIM card the attacker possesses. We found that all ﬁve carriers used insecure authentication challenges that could be easily subverted by attackers. We also found that attackers generally only needed to target the most vulnerable authentication challenges, because the rest could be bypassed. Authentication of SIM swap requests presents a classic usability-security trade-off, with carriers underemphasizing security. In an anecdotal evaluation of postpaid accounts at three carriers, presented in Appendix A, we also found—very tentatively—that some carriers may have implemented stronger authentication for postpaid accounts than for prepaid accounts. To quantify the downstream effects of these vulnerabilities, we reverse-engineered the authentication policies of over 140 websites that offer phone-based authentication. We rated the level of vulnerability of users of each website to a SIM swap attack, and have released our ﬁndings as an annotated dataset on issms2fasecure.com . Notably, we found 17 websites on which user accounts can be compromised based on a SIM swap alone, i.e., without a password compromise. We encountered failures in vulnerability disclosure processes that resulted in these vulnerabilities remaining unﬁxed by nine of the 17 companies despite our responsible disclosure. Finally, we analyzed enterprise MFA solutions from three vendors, ﬁnding that two of them give users inadequate control over the security-usability tradeoff.",

Analysis of surveys (n = 674) of WhatsApp users in Saudi Arabia and India revealed that Saudis had significantly higher concerns about being contacted by strangers. In contrast, Indians showed significantly higher concerns with respect to social contact from professional colleagues. Demographics impinge privacy preferences in both populations, but in different ways. Results from regression analysis show that there are statistically significant differences between the privacy behaviors of Saudis and Indians. In both cases, privacy concerns were strongly correlated with their reported privacy behaviors. Despite the differences, we identified technical solutions that could address the concerns of both populations of participants. We close by discussing the applicability of our recommendations, specifically those on transparency and consent, to other applications and domains. ∗Research performed while author was at Indiana University.

We conducted an observational study of couples experiencing memory concerns (one or both) while the partners engaged in the process of reviewing and selecting “Safety Setting” options for online activities. Couples’ choices tended to be influenced by a desire to secure shared assets through mutual surveillance and a desire to preserve autonomy by granting freedom in social and personal activities. The availability of choice suits the uneven and unpredictable process of memory loss and couples’ acknowledged uncertainty about its trajectory, leading them to anticipate changing Safety Settings as one or both of them experience further cognitive decline. Reflecting these three decision drivers, we conclude with implications for a design system that offers flexibility and adaptability in variety of settings, accommodates the uncertainty of memory loss, preserves autonomy, and supports collaborative management",

However, current audio CAPTCHA designs are slower to complete and less accurate than their visual counterparts. We designed and evaluated four novel audio CAPTCHAs that we hypothesized would increase accuracy and speed. To evaluate our designs along these measures, we ran a three-session, within-subjects experiment with 67 PVIs from around the world — the majority being from the U.S. and India. Thirty three participants completed all three sessions, each separated by one week. These participants completed a total of 39 distinct audio CAPTCHA challenges across our prototype designs and the control, all presented in random order. Most importantly, all four of our new designs were significantly more accurate and faster than the control condition, and were rated as preferable over the control. A post-hoc security evaluation suggested that our designs had different strengths and weaknesses vis-a-vis two adversaries: a random guessing adversary and a NLP adversary. Ultimately, our results suggest that the best design to use is dependent on use-context.",

Taking the perspective that sexting is a normal intimacy-building behavior rather than a deviant practice that should be prevented, this work studies the computer security and privacy mental models and technology use of adults who sext. We conducted an online survey of adults who have sexted (N = 247), asking participants about which platforms they use to sext, their general sexting behaviors, what security and privacy concerns they have around sexting, and how they mitigate those concerns. We find, for example, significant concerns around sexts participants send “getting out” and being misused, as well as concerns around receiving unsolicited sexts. We also find that while participants use some technical strategies (e.g., using platforms with disappearing messages), they commonly rely on non-technical strategies like trust in their partner to mitigate concerns. We ground our findings in Citron’s legal framework of sexual privacy to support individual autonomy, intimacy, and equality, and we make design recommendations for communication platforms to support usable security and privacy for sexting.",

Naiakshina et al. [28] examined the ecological validity of a password storage study conducted with students [29, 30] by hiring freelancers from Freelancer.com. In the hope of increasing the ecologically validity, Naiakshina et al. used a deception study design wherein freelance developers were hired for a regular job using a company front created for the study, instead of openly telling the freelancers that they were taking part in a study. Based on their results, Naiakshina et al. propose the use of online freelancers to be examined further, to supplement other recruitment channels such as CS students and GitHub users. The deception in their study was used with the aim that results would reflect the real work of online freelancers. However, deception needs to be used with careful consideration, which can entail additional study design work and negotiations with ethical oversight bodies. In this paper, we take a closer look at the deception used in Naiakshina et al.’s study. Therefore, we replicate Naiakshina et al.’s work but announce and run it as a study on Freelancer.com. Our findings suggest that for this password storage study deception did not have a large effect and the open recruitment without deception was a viable recruitment method.

As a result, in addition to delivering pleasing and aesthetic devices, smart home product designers need to factor security and privacy into the design of their devices. Further, the need for user-centered security and privacy design is particularly important for such an environment, given that inhabitants are demographically-diverse (e.g., age, gender, educational level) and have different skills and (dis)abilities. Prior work has explored different usable security and privacy solutions for smart homes; however, the applicability of user experience (UX) principles to security and privacy design is under-explored. In this paper, we present a qualitative study to explore the development of smart home cameras manufactured by three companies. We conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 designers and their collaborators, and analyze these interviews using Grounded Theory. We find that UX was seen as helpful by our participants in fostering innovation in the design of privacy solutions. However, UX was not used or considered in the design of security solutions due to an explicit need for established, tried-and-tested solutions (i.e., previous traditional security solutions that were seen as effective and reliable to fix certain design problems). Drawing from the findings of our study, we propose a model of UX factors influencing security and privacy design of smart home cameras. We also extract a set of recommendations to improve the security and privacy design of smart cameras. We finally outline several areas for future investigation. Copyright is held by the author/owner.

Two PhD students in computer science trained in qualitative methods were embedded in a software company for 1.5 years of total research time. The researchers participated in everyday work activities such as coding and meetings, and observed software (in)security phenomena both through investigating historical data (code repositories and ticketing system records), and through pen-testing the developed software and observing developers’ and management’s reactions to the discovered vulnerabilities. Our study found that 1) security vulnerabilities are sometimes intentionally introduced and/or overlooked due to the difficulty in managing the various stakeholders’ responsibilities in an economic ecosystem, and cannot be simply blamed on developers’ lack of knowledge or skills; 2) accidental vulnerabilities discovered in the pen-testing process produce different reactions in the development team, often times contrary to what a security researcher would predict. These findings highlight the nuanced nature of the root causes of software vulnerabilities and indicate the need to take into account a significant amount of contextual information to understand how and why software vulnerabilities emerge during software development. Rather than simply addressing deficits in developer knowledge or practice, this research sheds light on at times forgotten human factors that significantly impact the security of software developed by actual companies.

The usable security community has successfully identified and remedied usability issues in end user security applications, like PGP and Tor browsers, by conducting usability evaluations. Inspired by the success of these studies, we conducted a heuristic walkthrough evaluation and user study focused on four security-oriented static analysis tools. Through the lens of these evaluations, we identify several issues that detract from the usability of static analysis tools.

HRE is a complex process in which semi-automated steps are interwoven with human sense-making processes. Currently, little is known about the technical and cognitive processes which determine the success of HRE. This paper performs an initial investigation on how reverse engineers solve problems, how manual and automated analysis methods interact, and which cognitive factors play a role. We present the results of an exploratory behavioral study with eight participants that was conducted after they had completed a 14-week training. We explored the validity of our findings by comparing them with the behavior (strategies applied and solution time) of an HRE expert. The participants were observed while solving a realistic HRE task. We tested cognitive abilities of our participants and collected large sets of behavioral data from log files. By comparing the least and most efficient reverse engineers, we were able to observe successful strategies. Moreover, our analyses suggest a phase model for reverse engineering, consisting of three phases. Our descriptive results further indicate that the cognitive factor Working Memory (WM) might play a role in efficiently solving HRE problems. Our exploratory study builds the foundation for future research in this topic and outlines ideas for designing cognitively difficult countermeasures (“cognitive obfuscation”) against HRE.

Network and Information Systems Security (NIS) Directive is the first Europeanscale attempt to establish a high standard of cyber security among CNIs. NIS raises questions about defining scope, providing evidence or mobilizing funding. Most importantly, there is the fundamental question whether it would become a tick-box exercise or lead to long-term improvements in security practices. We interviewed 30 cyber security practitioners in the UK to gather an in-depth understanding of NIS implementation and its probable futures. Our analysis found that the emerging field of Operational Technology Security is yet to formulate norms, standards and career trajectories. We are, therefore, at a critical junction, where the scope of the profession is shaping together with the need for evidence-based policy advice. Our findings are twofold: (1) a number of security tropes (e.g., “security solutions are the same across the sectors”), which may drive implementation of regulations such as NIS; (2) a classification of cyber security practices mapping the diversity of policy interpretations. We conclude with recommendations for policymakers and CNI operators.",

Prior work has proposed nudging interventions to help users adopt security experts’ recommendations. We designed and tested nudging interventions based on protection motivation theory (PMT) and implementation intentions (II) to encourage participants to use secure mobile payments. We designed the interventions using an interview study with 20 participants, and then tested them in a longitudinal, between-subjects field experiment with 411 participants. In one condition, drawing on PMT, we informed participants about the threat of card fraud and the protection offered by mobile payments. In a second condition, we combined the PMT intervention with an II-based intervention, and asked participants to formulate a plan to make a mobile payment in the week ahead. A third condition acted as a control. Both PMT-only and PMT+II interventions made participants more likely to make mobile payments relative to the control group. The results suggest that PMT and implementation intentionbased nudges can help people translate their desire to behave securely into actual behavior.",

Builtin connections between these services are still emerging, but end-user-programming tools such as If-This-Then-That (IFTTT) have existed for almost a decade, allowing users to create rules (called applets in IFTTT) that dictate interactions between devices and services. Previous work found potential secrecy or integrity violations in many applets, but did so without examining how individual users interact with the service. In this work, we study the risks of real-world use of IFTTT by collecting and analyzing 732 applets installed by 28 participants and participants’ responses to several survey questions. We found that significantly fewer applets than previously thought pose realistic secrecy or integrity risks to the users who install them. Consistent with this finding, participants were generally not concerned about potential harms, even when these were explained to them. However, examining participants’ applets led us to identify several new types of privacy risks, which challenge some assumptions inherent in previous analyses that focus on secrecy and integrity risks. For example, we found that many applets involve monitoring incidental users: family, friends, and neighbors who may interact with someone else’s smart-home devices, possibly without realizing it. We discuss what our findings imply for automatically identifying potentially harmful applets. Copyright is held by the author/owner.

We replicated this survey with a more diverse sample ( n=299 ), including different age groups and educational backgrounds. We were able to confirm many of the original findings, providing further evidence that certain characteristics of stories increase the likelihood of learning and retelling. Moreover, we contribute new insights into how people learn from stories, such as that younger and higher educated people are less likely to change their thinking or be emotionally influenced by stories. We (re)discovered all of the threat themes found by Rader et al., suggesting that these threats have not been eliminated in the last decade, and found new ones such as ransomware and data breaches.

We present a user study investigating expert users’ strategies to detect signature spooﬁng attacks in Thunderbird. We observed 25 expert users while they classiﬁed eight emails as either having a legitimate signature or not. Studying expert users explicitly gives us an upper bound of attack detection rates of all users dealing with PGP signatures. 52% of participants fell for at least one out of four signature spooﬁng attacks. Overall, participants did not have an established strategy for evaluating email signature legitimacy. We observed our participants apply 23 different types of checks when inspecting signed emails, but only 8 of these checks tended to be useful in identifying the spoofed or invalid signatures. In performing their checks, participants were frequently startled, confused, or annoyed with the user interface, which they found supported them little. All these results paint a clear picture: Even expert users struggle to verify email signatures, usability issues in email security are not limited to novice users, and developers may need proper guidance on implementing email signature GUIs correctly.",

Similar studies have helped in other security ﬁelds to discover root causes or improve risk communication. Our study reveals two facets of practitioners’ mental models of machine learning security. Firstly, practitioners often confuse machine learning security with threats and defences that are not directly related to machine learning. Secondly, in contrast to most academic research, our participants perceive security of machine learning as not solely related to individual models, but rather in the context of entire workﬂows that consist of multiple components. Jointly with our additional ﬁndings, these two facets provide a foun-dation to substantiate mental models for machine learning security and have implications for the integration of adversarial machine learning into corporate workﬂows, decreasing practitioners’ reported uncertainty, and appropriate regulatory frameworks for machine learning security.",

After having translated the original questionnaire into German, we conducted two studies with an average of 728 participants. While we could conﬁrm that participants did not fully understand differential privacy and that a new method to communicate the effects of differential privacy is needed, participants in our study were more willing to share data than the participants from USA and India.

We compare users’ perceptions of anti-stalkerware with the technical reality. First, we applied thematic analysis to app reviews to analyze user perceptions. Then, we performed a cognitive walkthrough of two prominent anti-stalkerware apps available on the Google Play Store and reverse-engineered them to understand their detection features. Our results suggest that users base their trust on the look and feel of the app, the number and type of alerts, and the apps’ affordances.

Based on a three-phase framework, we extracted and generated metaphors for differentially private data analysis models (local and central). We analytically evaluated the metaphors based on experts’ feedback and then empirically evaluated them in online interviews with 30 participants. Our results showed that the metaphorical explanations can suc-cessfully convey that perturbation protects privacy and that there is a privacy-accuracy trade-off. Nonetheless, conveying information at a high level leads to incorrect expectations that negatively affect users’ understanding and limits the ability to apply the concept to different contexts.

In addition, the technology did not readily resolve questions about whether the user, identity provider, or relying party was in control of data at crucial moments. We also learned that users’ judgments of data minimization encompass a broader scope of issues than simply the technical provision of the identity wallet. Our results contribute to understanding future user-centric identity technologies from the view of privacy and user acceptance.",

Towards this end, we implemented a study environment that we will release as open source to support further studies. Our results support two major conclusions: 1) tpm2-tools APIs, as designed, are not designed to be developer-friendly, and 2) One of the major causes for these usability issues is in the TPM specifications. Since other libraries also mirror the specifications and provide no significant usability improve-ments, our results are likely to indicate similar issues with all current TPM library APIs. We provide recommendations for improving the TPM library APIs documentation and software, and we highlight the need for HCI experts to review TPM specifications to preemptively address usability pitfalls.",

Verifiability has been used in actual elections, but this is not the case for code voting due to usability concerns. There is little evidence from empirical studies attesting to its usability. Our main contribution is to extend an existing verifiable voting system (used for real world elections) with a code-voting approach to improve the system’s security properties. We minimise voter effort as corresponding QR codes are scanned instead of requiring manual code entry. We conducted a user study to evaluate the general usability of this proposal as well as its manipulation-detection efficacy. In particular, we found that extending the considered verifiable voting systems with code-voting approaches to enhance vote secrecy is feasible because we could not observe a significant decrease in general usability while manipulation detection improved significantly.",

This study tests whether people are better at detecting phishing e-mails when they are only presented with user-facing e-mail headers, instead of full e-mails. Results from a representative sample show that most phishing e-mails were detected by less than 30% of the participants, regardless of which e-mail part was displayed. In fact, phishing detection was worst when only e-mail headers were provided. Thus, people still fall for phishing, because they do not recognize online impersonation tactics.

Our analysis reveals considerable misalignment between the constructs associated with the statements and participant understanding. Many statements used in scales or that we developed with the intention to measure constructs such as privacy concern, are seen by survey participants as describing other constructs, such as privacy preferences. We also ﬁnd that no statement uniquely measured any one construct, though some more reliably track their target construct than others. Our ﬁndings constitute an epistemological problem for use of scales in the existing literature (are they capturing what we think they capture?) and a practical problem for construction of new scales (how to ensure construct validity in the face of ill-deﬁned constructs and evolving privacy landscape?).

We present three case studies using medium- to large-scale longitudinal panels, which all collect privacy- and security-sensitive data. In evaluating factors related to recruitment, retention, and data collection, we provide a foundation to inform the design of future long-term panel studies. Through these studies, we observe that monetary and nonmonetary incentives can be effective in recruiting panel participants, although each presents trade-offs and potential biases. Contrary to our initial expectations, we ﬁnd that users do not behave any differently in their ﬁrst few weeks of participation than in the remainder of their time in the study. In terms of retention, we note that personalized enrollment follow-ups can lower initial dropout rates, but they are challenging and costly to scale. Communication, including following up with inactive users, is vital to retention. However, ﬁnding the right balance of communication is equally important. Interfering with a participant’s everyday device use is a sure way to lose users.

We conduct an online survey on MTurk ( n = 800), a gender-balanced survey on Prolific ( n = 800), and a representative survey on Prolific ( n = 800) and compare the responses to a probabilistic survey conducted by the Pew Research Center ( n = 4272). We find that MTurk response quality has degraded over the last five years, and our results do not replicate the earlier finding about the generalizability of MTurk responses. By contrast, we find that data collected through Prolific is generally representative for questions about user perceptions and experiences, but not for questions about security and privacy knowledge.

Therefore, our study ( N = 95) examined possible situational (effort necessary to invade privacy) and individual determinants (e.g., personality) of PIB in a three-phase experiment. 1) Laboratory phase: participants were immersed into the scenario; 2) privacy-invasion-phase at home: automatically and covertly capturing participants’ PIB; 3) debriefing-phase at home: capturing whether participants admit PIB. Our results contribute to understanding the sociotechnical environment in which PIB occurs showing that most participants engaged in PIB, that the likelihood of PIB increased when it required less effort, that participants less likely admitted PIB for more sensitive information, and that individual characteristics affected whether participants admitted PIB.

Approaches to combat misinformation may also differ amongst younger and older adults. In this paper, we investigate how young adults encountered and dealt with misinformation on WhatsApp in private group chats during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we conducted a qualitative interview study with 16 WhatsApp users who were university students based in the United States. We uncovered three main findings. First, all participants encountered misinformation multiple times a week in group chats, often attributing the source of misinformation to be well-intentioned family members. Second, although participants were able to identify misinformation and fact-check using diverse methods, they often remained passive to avoid negatively impacting family relations. Third, participants agreed that WhatsApp bears a responsibility to curb misinformation on the platform but expressed concerns about its ability to do so given the platform's steadfast commitment to content privacy. Our findings suggest that conventional content moderation techniques used by open platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are unfit to tackle misinformation on WhatsApp. We offer alternative design suggestions that take into consideration the social nuances and privacy commitments of end-to-end encrypted group chats. Our paper also contributes to discussions between platform designers, researchers, and end users on misinformation in privacypreserving environments more broadly. © 2022 by The USENIX Association.

To this end, we report the results of a census-representative online survey in Germany ( n = 800) conducted in December 2021, complemented with 30 qualitative street interviews. Most participants favor digital certificates over paper-based variants due to their ease of use and seamless integration into dedicated smartphone apps – more than 75 % of participants have installed one or more eligible app(s) on their phone.

[44], it was shown that developers who did not use resources to copy and paste code did not produce any secure solutions at all. This highlights how essential programming resources are for security. Inspired by the Let’s Encrypt and Certbot that support admins in conﬁguring TLS, we created a programming aid called Let’s Hash to help developers create secure password authentication code easily. We created two versions. The ﬁrst is a collection of code snippets developers can use, and the second adds a wizard interface on top that guides developers through the decisions which need to be made and creates the complete code for them. To evaluate the security and usability of Let’s Hash, we conducted a study with 179 freelance developers, asking them to solve three password programming tasks. Both versions of Let’s Hash signiﬁcantly outperformed the baseline condition in which developers used their regular resources. On average, Let’s Hash users were between 5 and 32 times as likely to create secure code than those in the control condition.",

In general, participants liked Windows Hello and found it more usable than the traditional Windows sign-in scheme. Windows Hello was faster and perceived as more responsive than the traditional Windows login. However, participants tended to use PINs as a replacement for their (longer) passwords instead of using biometrics.

This has led to more challenging tests that require greater human effort and cultural knowledge; they may prevent bots effectively but sacriﬁce usability and dis-courage the human users they are meant to admit. We propose a new class of challenge: a Cryptographic Attestation of Personhood (CAP) as the foundation of a usable, pro-privacy alternative. Our challenge is constructed using the open Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) that is supported in most browsers. We evaluated the CAP challenge through a public demo, with an accompanying user survey. Our evaluation in-dicates that CAP has a strong likelihood of adoption by users who possess the necessary hardware, showing good results for effectiveness and efﬁciency as well as a strong expressed preference for using CAP over traditional CAPTCHA solutions. In addition to demonstrating a mechanism for more usable challenge tests, we identify some areas for improvement for the WebAuthn user experience, and reﬂect on the difﬁcult usable privacy problems in this domain and how they might be mitigated.",

To mitigate this problem, our study proposes and evaluates one potential privacy control, in which the assistant requests permission for the information it wishes to use immediately after hearing it. To ﬁnd out how people would react to runtime permission requests, we recruited 23 pairs of participants to hold conversations while receiving ambient suggestions from a proactive assistant, which we simulated in real time using the Wizard of Oz technique. The interactive sessions featured different modes and designs of runtime permission requests and were followed by in-depth interviews about people’s preferences and concerns. Most participants were excited about the devices despite their continuous listening, but wanted control over the assistant’s actions and their own data. They generally prioritized an interruption-free experience above more ﬁne-grained control over what the device would hear.",

Through a qualitative study, this research explored whether normative beliefs inﬂuenced participants’ reactions to plausible but unexpected inferences that could be made from sensor data collected by everyday wearable and smart home devices. Some reactions were grounded in normative beliefs involving existing disclosure taboos, while others stigmatized the choice to limit one’s use of technologies to preserve one’s privacy. The visible nature of others’ technology use contra-dicts individual concern about sensor data privacy, which may lead to an incorrect assumption that privacy is not important to other people.

This device sharing can result in privacy concerns since the owner’s personal data may become vulnerable to unauthorized access. Existing solutions have usability problems and neglect human factors of sharing practices. For example, since device sharing implies trust between people, explicitly hiding data may signal mistrust. Besides, an owner may fail to enable a sharing-protection mechanism due to forgetfulness or lack of risk perception. Therefore, we propose device sharing awareness (DSA), a new sharing-protection approach for temporarily shared devices, which detects a sharing event proactively and enables sharing protection subtly . DSA exploits natural handover gestures and behavioral biometrics for proactive sharing detection to transparently enable and disable a device’s sharing mode without requiring explicit input. It also supports various access control strategies to fulfill sharing requirements imposed by an app. Our user study evaluates handover detection over 3,700 data clips (n=18) and compre-hensive device sharing processing over 50 sessions (n=10). The evaluation results show that DSA can accurately detect handover gestures and automatically process sharing events to provide a secure sharing environment.",

This paper presents findings from 25 semi-structured interviews with domestic childcare workers in the U.S. about smart home cameras, focusing on how privacy considerations interact with the dynamics of their employer–employee relationships. We show how participants’ views on camera data collection, and their desire and ability to set conditions on data use and sharing, were affected by power differentials and norms about who should control information flows in a given context. Participants’ attitudes about employers’ cameras often hinged on how employers used the data; whether participants viewed camera use as likely to reinforce negative tendencies in the employer–employee relationship; and how camera use and disclosure might reflect existing relationship tendencies. We also suggest technical and social interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of power imbalances on domestic employees’ privacy and individual agency.",

Efforts to address such concerns must build on an in-depth understanding of older adults’ perceptions and preferences about data privacy and security for these technologies, and accounting for variance in physical and cognitive abilities. In semi-structured interviews with 46 older adults, we identified a range of complex privacy and security attitudes and needs specific to this population, along with common threat models, misconceptions, and mitigation strategies. Our work adds depth to current models of how older adults’ limited technical knowledge, experience, and age-related declines in ability amplify vulnerability to certain risks; we found that health, living situation, and finances play a notable role as well. We also found that older adults often experience usability issues or technical uncertainties in mitigating those risks—and that managing privacy and security concerns frequently consists of limiting or avoiding technology use.

We report on a semistructured interview study (n=19) investigating what users have learned about computer security from mass media and how they evaluate what is and is not realistic within fictional portrayals. In addition to confirming prior findings that television and film shape users’ mental models of security, we identify specific misconceptions that appear to align directly with common fictional tropes.

Prior work, in usable security and persuasive design, suggests that answering these questions is critical if we are to design systems that encourage pro-S&P behaviors. Accordingly, we asked 852 online survey respondents about their most recent S&P behaviors (n = 1947), what led up to those behaviors, and if they shared those behaviors. We found that social “triggers”, where people interacted with or observed others, were most common, followed by proactive triggers, where people acted absent of an external stimulus, and lastly by forced triggers, where people were forced to act. People from different age groups, nationalities, and levels of security behavioral intention (SBI) all varied in which triggers were dominant. Most importantly, people with low-to-medium SBI most commonly reported social triggers. Furthermore, participants were four times more likely to share their behavior changes with others when they, themselves, reported a social trigger.",

Now, roughly four years later, we aimed to replicate and extend this study with a similar set of non-experts and a different set of experts. For the non-experts, we recruited 288 MTurk participants, just as Ion et al. did. We also recruited 75 mostly European security experts, in contrast to the mostly US sample from Ion et al. Our findings show that despite the different samples and the four years that have passed, the most common pieces of expert advice are mostly unchanged, with one notable exception. In addition, we did see a fair amount of fluctuation in the long tail of advice. Non-expert self-reported behavior, however, is unchanged, meaning that the gap between experts and non-experts seen in Ion et al.’s work is still just as prominent in our study. To extend the work, we also conducted an A/B study to get a better understanding of one of the key questions concerning experts’ recommendations, and we identified types of advice where research by the usable security community is most sorely needed.",

To this end, we conducted a three-phase redesign of the warning notifications surrounding the authentication ceremony in Signal. Our results show how improved comprehension can be achieved while still promoting favorable privacy outcomes among users. Our experience reaffirms existing arguments that users should be empowered to make personal trade-offs between perceived risk and response cost.

Our research investigates approaches to enhance privacy while supporting legitimate access for human decision making by capitalizing on the fact that in most human-computer hybrid systems, only a small fraction of the full data is required for human judgment. We present an interactive visual system for record linkage – a task that requires human decision-making about whether different but similar data records refer to the same person. The system employs an on-demand interactive interface that incrementally discloses partial information only when needed and other feedback mechanisms to promote ethical behavior. We evaluate our approach with a controlled experiment of how different types of feedback and access restrictions affect human decision-making quality, speed, and access behavior. The on-demand interactive interface reduced privacy risk to only 7.85%, compared to 100% when all data is disclosed, with little to no impact on decision quality or completion time. In addition, feedback from an expert review supports the notion that an intermediate level of access other than “all or nothing” can provide better accuracy than no access but more protection than full access.",

As MPC protocols transition from research prototypes to realworld applications, the usability of MPC-enabled applications is increasingly critical to their successful deployment and widespread adoption. Our Web-MPC platform, designed with a focus on usability, has been deployed for privacy-preserving data aggregation initiatives with the City of Boston and the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. After building and deploying an initial version of the platform, we conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify usability improvements and implemented corresponding application enhancements. However, it is difficult to gauge the effectiveness of these changes within the context of real-world deployments using traditional web analytics tools without compromising the security guarantees of the platform. This work consists of two contributions that address this challenge: (1) the Web-MPC platform has been extended with the capability to collect web analytics using existing MPC protocols, and (2) as a test of this feature and a way to inform future work, this capability has been leveraged to conduct a usability study comparing the two versions of Web-MPC. While many efforts have focused on ways to enhance the usability of privacy-preserving technologies, this study serves as a model for using a privacy-preserving data-driven approach to evaluate and enhance the usability of privacy-preserving websites and applications deployed in realworld scenarios. Data collected in this study yields insights into the relationship between usability and security; these can help inform future implementations of MPC solutions.

In this paper we take a first step towards answering this question. To this end, we analyze almost 10 000 valid certificates queried from phishing websites and compare them to almost 40 000 certificates collected from benign sites. Our analysis shows that it is generally impossible to differentiate between benign sites and phishing sites based on the content of their certificates alone.

While recent studies have investigated the software updating practices of end users, system administrators have received less attention. Yet, system administrators manage numerous machines for their organizations, and security lapses at these hosts can lead to damaging attacks. To improve security at scale, we therefore also need to understand how this specific population behaves and how to help administrators keep machines up-to-date. In this paper, we study how system administrators manage software updates. We surveyed 102 administrators and interviewed 17 indepth to understand their processes and how their methods impact updating effectiveness. We find that system administrators proceed through software updates through five main stages that, while similar to those of end users, involve significantly different considerations and actions performed, highlighting the value of focusing specifically on the administrator population. By gathering evidence on how administrators conduct updates, we identify challenges that they encountered and limitations of existing procedures at all stages of the updating process. We observe issues with comprehensively acquiring meaningful information about available updates, effectively testing and deploying updates in a timely manner, recovering from update-induced problems, and interacting with organizational and management influences. Moving forward, we propose directions for future research and community actions that may help system administrators perform updates more effectively.",

In a prestudy (N=114), we developed visual text annotations to communicate modifications of typing behaviour (for example, gap between letters indicates how fast to move between keys). In a lab study (N=24), participants entered given passwords with such modification instructions on a smartphone in two sessions a week apart. Our results show that users successfully control and modify typing features (flight time, hold time, touch area, touch-to-key offset), yet certain combinations are challenging.

Here we describe a semi-structured interview study with 30 participants that allows us to provide a more comprehensive picture of the mindsets underlying adoption and effective use of password managers and password-generation features. Our participants include users who use no password-specific tools at all, those who use password managers built into browsers or operating systems, and those who use separately installed password managers. Furthermore, past field data has indicated that users of built-in, browser-based password managers more often use weak and reused passwords than users of separate password managers that have password generation available by default. Our interviews suggest that users of built-in password managers may be driven more by convenience, while users of separately installed tools appear more driven by security. We advocate tailored designs for these two mentalities and provide actionable suggestions to induce effective password manager usage.",

Prior research on security keys has revealed intuitive usability concerns, but there are open challenges to better understand user experiences with heterogeneous devices and to determine an optimal user experience for everyday Web browsing. In this paper we contribute to the growing usable security literature on security keys through two user studies: (i) a lab-based study evaluating the first-time user experience of a cross-vendor set of security keys and SMS-based one-time passcodes; (ii) a diary study, where we collected 643 entries detailing how participants accessed accounts and experienced one particular security key over the period of one week. In the former we discovered that user sentiment towards SMS codes was typically higher than for security keys generally. In the latter we discovered that only 28% of accesses to security key-enabled online accounts actually involved a button press on a security key. Our findings confirm prior work that reports user uncertainty about the benefits of security keys and their security purpose. We conclude that this can be partly explained by experience with online services that support security keys, but may nudge users away from regular use of those security keys.",

We conducted a two-week, between-subjects usability study of five common 2FA methods with 72 participants, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data.

Although users may fail to heed a security warning for a variety of reasons, a major contributor is habituation, which is decreased response to repeated stimulation. However, the scope of this problem may actually be much broader than previously thought because of the neurobiological phenomenon of generalization. Whereas habituation describes a diminished response with repetitions of the same stimulus, generalization occurs when habituation to one stimulus carries over to other novel stimuli that are similar in appearance. Generalization has important implications for the domains of usable security and human–computer interaction. Because a basic principle of user interface design is visual consistency, generalization suggests that through exposure to frequent non-security-related notifications (e.g., dialogs, alerts, confirmations, etc.) that share a similar look and feel, users may become deeply habituated to critical security warnings that they have never seen before. Further, with the increasing number of notifications in our lives across a range of mobile, Internet of Things, and computing devices, the accumulated effect of generalization may be substantial.

Our results reveal that while people are uncertain about manufacturers' data practices, users' knowledge of their smart home does not strongly influence their threat models and protection behaviors. Instead, users' perceptions and concerns are largely shaped by their experiences in other computing contexts and with organizations. Based on our findings, we provide several recommendations for policymakers, researchers and designers to contribute to users' risk awareness and security and privacy practices in the smart home.",

                    "abstract": "Smart Home Personal Assistants (SPA) such as Amazon Echo/Alexa and Google Home/Assistant have made our daily routines much more convenient, allowing us to complete tasks quickly and efficiently using natural language. It is believed that around 10% of consumers around the world already own an SPA, and predictions are that ownership will keep rising. It is therefore paramount to make SPA secure and privacypreserving. Despite the growing research on SPA security and privacy, little is known about users’ security and privacy perceptions concerning SPA complex ecosystem, which involves several elements and stakeholders. To explore this, we considered the main four use case scenarios with distinctive architectural elements and stakeholders involved: using builtin skills, third-party skills, managing other smart devices, and shopping, through semi-structured interviews with SPA users. Using a grounded theory approach, we found that users have incomplete mental models of SPA, leading to different perceptions of where data is being stored, processed, and shared. Users’ understanding of the SPA ecosystem is often limited to their household and the SPA vendor at most, even when using third-party skills or managing other smart home devices. This leads to incomplete threat models (few threat agents and types of attacks) and non-technical coping strategies they implement to protect themselves. We also found that users are not making the most of the shopping capabilities of SPA due to security and privacy concerns; and while users perceive SPA as intelligent and capable of learning, they would not like SPA learning everything about them. Based on these findings, we discuss design recommendations. Copyright is held by the author/owner.

Here we revisit a series of user-centred studies which focus on security mechanisms as part of regular routines, such as two-factor authentication. By examining routine security behaviours, these studies expose perceived contributors and consequences of security fatigue, and the strategies that a person may adopt when feeling overburdened by security. Behaviours and strategies are framed according to a model of cognitive control modes, to explore the role of human performance and error in producing security fatigue. Security tasks are then considered in terms of modes such as unconscious routines and knowledge-based ad-hoc approaches. Conscious attention can support adaptation to novel security situations, but is error-prone and tiring; both simple security routines and technology-driven automation can minimise effort, but may miss cues from the environment that a nuanced response is required.",

In this paper, we propose Conversational Privacy Bots (PriBots) as a new way of delivering notice and choice through a two-way dialogue between the user and a computer agent (a chatbot). PriBots improve on state-of-the-art by offering users a more intuitive and natural interface to inquire about their privacy settings, thus allowing them to control their privacy. In addition to presenting the potential applications of PriBots, we describe the underlying system needed to support their functionality. We also delve into the challenges associated with delivering privacy as an automated service.

We extend this research by examining design factors such as narrator gender, animation style, music tone, and color scheme. We implemented a field experiment and survey to determine how variations in these design elements affect consumers’ perceived risk, perceived benefits, and disclosure decisions. The results indicate that the most effective privacy policy videos use female narrators with vibrant color palettes and light musical tones.

As a result, the privacy controls it anchors are being applied in an inconsistent, ad hoc, and precarious manner. This paper briefly introduces a novel approach to domesticate REP and operationalize its application through privacy controls by taking cues from the playbook of network science. This approach re-conceptualizes information privacy as a scale-free network that follows power law dynamics, and it suggests gauging privacy risk by looking at the nature and quality of links and nodes controlling personal information artifacts rather than whether the interface to data is deemed public or private. Conjecturally, the resulting privacy framework will achieve balance between individual rights protection and public good goals by advocating a regime of reciprocal obligations between the countervailing interests: the recognition of a more nuanced privacy continuum by private information controllers and more overt manifestations of REP by privacy subjects, both steeped in a network theory-informed understanding of information flows.",

Therefore, several design proposals that substitute the classic privacy notice have been employed to different audience and in different contexts as a means to enhance user’s awareness. However, there is still a shortage in having a notice display that helps users shape a coherent idea about app’s data gathering practice and seamlessly allowing them to compare different application alternatives based on their data gathering practices. In this work, we propose an approach to quantify the amount of data collection of an application by analyzing its privacy policy text using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. There are in fact numerous use cases for such a quantitative measure, one of which is designing a visceral notice that relies on an experiential approach to communicate privacy information to users. The results show that our quantification approach holds promise. Using our quantification measure, we propose a new display for nano-sized visceral notice in which we leverage user’s familiarity with pie chart as a data measuring tool to communicate information about an app’s data collection practice.",

Although these apps access this data to provide users with specific services, they can also use it for monetization or profiling purposes. In practice, there is a significant gap between users’ privacy expectations and the actual access levels of 3rd party apps, which are often over-privileged. Due to weaknesses in the existing privacy indicators, users are generally not well-informed on what data these apps get. Even more, we are witnessing the rise of inverse privacy: 3rd parties collect data that enables them to know information about users that users do not know, cannot remember, or cannot reach. In this paper, we describe our recent experiences with the design and evaluation of Data-Driven Privacy Indicators (DDPIs), an approach attempting to reduce the aforementioned privacy gap. DDPIs are realized through analyzing user’s data by a trusted party (e.g., the app platform) and integrating the analysis results in the privacy indicator’s interface. We discuss DDPIs in the context of 3rd party apps on cloud platforms, such as Google Drive and Dropbox. Specifically, we present our recent work on Far-reaching Insights, which show users the insights that apps can infer about them (e.g., their topics of interest, collaboration and activity patterns etc.). Then we present History-based insights, a novel privacy indicator which informs the user on what data is already accessible by an app vendor, based on previous app installations by the user or her collaborators. We further discuss future ideas on new DDPIs, and we outline the challenges facing the wide-scale deployment of such indicators.",

Context is information that allows a system to “characterize the situation of an entity, where an entity can be a person, place, or physical, or computational object” [4].

We conducted an preliminary IRB approved study in which 12 users were asked to play 3 of the most popular games available in the Google Play Store on an Android device while their touchscreen interactions were logged. We then applied a Support Vector Machine to classify users based on 19 extracted touchscreen usage features.

PROBLEM MOTIVATION Given the fact that personal mobile devices provide access to and/or store a great deal of personal and sensitive data, including passwords, contacts, files, emails, etc., it is not surprising that unauthorized access to the device is one of the highest security risks for smartphone users. To protect such data and services from unauthorized access, some smartphone users lock their phones using PIN, password, biometrics and DAP (“draw a pattern”). Yet, others don’t, risking the data and online services accessible through their devices, mainly because of the inconvenience of unlocking, lack of motivation and awareness. One way to improve user behaviour is to offer them more usable unlocking mechanisms, without sacrificing the security. It remains an open problem, however, how to optimize both security and usability for smartphone unlocking mechanisms. Thus, it is important for researchers to understand the interplay between security and usability of unlocking mechanisms in situ. To this end, we are preparing a longitudinal field study, in the course of which our monitoring app installed on the participants’ Android smartphones will collect detailed relevant data.",

We found that the 3D immersed view worked best for memorability, and used this initial study to inspire the design for a novel mobile authentication application: the Memory Palace. We ran a within-subjects experiment to evaluate our Memory Palace authentication concept against Android's 9-dot Patternlock along two dimensions: memorability and resilience to shoulder surfing. Results from our experiment suggest people have significantly higher memorability for visual-spatial secrets encoded in the Memory Palace which were also significantly more resilient against shoulder surfing.

If they return to the website in five minutes, an hour, a day, or a week, should the browser show them the warning again or respect their previous decision? There is no clear industry consensus, with eight major browsers exhibiting four different HTTPS error exception storage policies. Ideally, a browser would not ask someone about the same warning over and over again. If a user believes the warning is a false alarm, repeated warnings undermine the browser’s trustworthiness without providing a security benefit. However, some people might change their mind, and we do not want one security mistake to become permanent. We evaluated six storage policies with a large-scale, multimonth field experiment. We found substantial differences between the policies and that one of the storage policies achieved more of our goals than the rest. Google Chrome 45 adopted our proposal, and it has proved successful since deployed. Subsequently, we ran Mechanical Turk and Google Consumer Surveys to learn about user expectations for warnings. Respondents generally lacked knowledge about Chrome’s new storage policy, but we remain satisfied with our proposal due to the behavioral benefits we have observed in the field.",

Prior research has shown that users are often unaware of, if not uncomfortable with, many of their permission settings. Prior work also suggests that it is theoretically possible to predict many of the privacy settings a user would want by asking the user a small number of questions. However, this approach has neither been operationalized nor evaluated with actual users before. We report on a field study (n=72) in which we implemented and evaluated a Personalized Privacy Assistant (PPA) with participants using their own Android devices. The results of our study are encouraging. We find that 78.7% of the recommendations made by the PPA were adopted by users. Following initial recommendations on permission settings, participants were motivated to further review and modify their settings with daily “privacy nudges.” Despite showing substantial engagement with these nudges, participants only changed 5.1% of the settings previously adopted based on the PPA’s recommendations.

Qualitative inductive thematic analysis of the interviews produced “engagement” as the overarching theme, whereby participants with greater engagement in computer security and maintenance did not necessarily have more secure computer states. Thus, user engagement alone may not be predictive of computer security. We identify several other themes that inform future directions for better design and research into security interventions. Our findings emphasize the need for better understanding of how users’ computers get infected, so that we can more effectively design user-centered mitigations.",

To achieve true message privacy, users need end-to-end message encryption, in which the communications service provider is not able to decrypt the content. Historically, end-to-end encryption has proven extremely difficult for people to use correctly, but recently tools like Apple’s iMessage and Google’s End-to-End have made it more broadly accessible by using key-directory services. These tools (and others like them) sacrifice some security properties for convenience, which alarms some security experts, but little is known about how average users evaluate these tradeoffs. In a 52-person interview study, we asked participants to complete encryption tasks using both a traditional key-exchange model and a key-directory-based registration model. We also described the security properties of each (varying the order of presentation) and asked participants for their opinions. We found that participants understood the two models well and made coherent assessments about when different tradeoffs might be appropriate. Our participants recognized that the less-convenient exchange model was more secure overall, but found the security of the registration model to be “good enough” for many everyday purposes.",

There is strong support for notification and consent when a system is intercepting their encrypted traffic, although this support varies depending on the situation. A significant concern about malicious uses of TLS inspection is identity theft, and many would react negatively and some would change their behavior if they discovered inspection occurring without their knowledge.

Thus far, it has been unclear how common it is for people to snoop on one another’s devices. Through an anonymity-preserving survey experiment, we quantify the pervasiveness of snooping attacks, defined as \"looking through someone else’s phone without their permission.\" We estimated the 1-year prevalence to be 31% in an online participant pool. Weighted to the U.S. population, the data indicates that 1 in 5 adults snooped on at least one other person’s phone, just in the year before the survey was conducted. We found snooping attacks to be especially prevalent among young people, and among those who are themselves smartphone users. In a follow-up study, we found that, among smartphone users, depth of adoption, like age, also predicts the probability of engaging in snooping attacks. In particular, the more people use their devices for personal purposes, the more likely they are to snoop on others, possibly because they become aware of the sensitive information that is kept, and how to access it. These findings suggest that, all else remaining equal, the prevalence of snooping attacks may grow, as more people adopt smartphones, and motivate further effort into improving defenses.",

Our goal is to gain an understanding of how much of a burden different kinds of authentication place on people, so that we can evaluate what kinds of improvements would most benefit them. We found that on average 25% of our participants’ authentications employed physical tokens such as car keys, which suggests that token-based authentication, in addition to password authentication, is a worthy area for improvement. We also found that our participants’ authentication behavior and opinions about authentication varied greatly, so any particular solution might not please everyone.

We address this concern by proposing several re-authentication configurations with varying levels of screen transparency and an optional time delay before displaying the authentication prompt. We conduct user studies with 30 participants to evaluate the usability and security perceptions of these configurations. We find that participants respond positively to our proposed changes and utilize the time delay while they are anticipating to get an authentication prompt to complete their current task. Though our findings indicate no differences in terms of task performance against these configurations, we find that the participants’ preferences for the configurations are context-based. They generally prefer the reauthentication configuration with a non-transparent background for sensitive applications, such as banking and photo apps, while their preferences are inclined towards convenient, usable configurations for medium and low sensitive apps or while they are using their devices at home.

The importance of viewing the viability of a solution from multiple perspectives has been largely ignored. Multiple perspectives arise because of inherent conflicts among the objectives a SOC has to meet and differences between the goals of the parties involved. During the 3.5 years that we have used anthropological fieldwork methods to study SOCs, we discovered that successful SOC innovations must resolve these conflicts to be effective in improving operational efficiency. This discovery was guided by Activity Theory (AT), which provided a framework for analyzing our fieldwork data. We use the version of AT proposed by Engeström to model SOC operations. Template analysis, a qualitative data analysis technique, guided by AT validated the existence of contradictions in SOCs. The same technique was used to elicit from the data concrete contradictions and how they were resolved. Our analysis provide evidence of the importance of conflict resolution as a prerequisite for operations improvement. AT enabled us to understand why some of our innovations worked in the SOCs we studied (and why others failed). AT helps us see a potentially successful and repeatable mechanism for introducing new technologies to future SOCs. Understanding and supporting all of the spoken and unspoken requirements of SOC analysts and managers appears to be the only way to get new technologies accepted and used in SOCs.",

In this paper, we investigate inference literacy: the beliefs and misconceptions people have about how companies collect and make inferences from their data. We interviewed 21 non-student participants with a high school education, finding that few believed companies can make the type of deeply personal inferences that companies now routinely make through machine learning. Instead, most participant's inference literacy beliefs clustered around one of two main concepts: one cluster believed companies make inferences about a person based largely on a priori stereotyping, using directly gathered demographic data; the other cluster believed that companies make inferences based on computer processing of online behavioral data, but often expected these inferences to be limited to straightforward intuitions. We also find evidence that cultural models related to income and ethnicity influence the assumptions that users make about their own role in the data economy. We share implications for research, design, and policy on tech savviness, digital inequality, and potential inference literacy interventions.",

In this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study focussed on understanding how users control the longitudinal exposure of their publicly shared data on social media sites. Our study, using data from Twitter, finds that a significant fraction of users withdraw a surprisingly large percentage of old publicly shared data—more than 28% of six-year old public posts (tweets) on Twitter are not accessible today. The inaccessible tweets are either selectively deleted by users or withdrawn by users when they delete or make their accounts private. We also found a significant problem with the current exposure control mechanisms – even when a user deletes her tweets or her account, the current mechanisms leave traces of residual activity, i.e., tweets from other users sent as replies to those deleted tweets or accounts still remain accessible. We show that using this residual information one can recover significant information about the deleted tweets or even characteristics of the deleted accounts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study th information leakage resulting from residual activities of deleted tweets and accounts. Finally, we propose an exposure control mechanism that eliminates information leakage via residual activities, while still allowing meaningful social interactions with user posts. We discuss its merits and drawbacks compared to existing mechanisms.",

Among these services, Facebook, which enjoys the largest population of active subscribers, has become a common place for sharing various types of HI. At the same time, Facebook was shown to be vulnerable to various attacks, resulting in unintended information disclosure, privacy invasion, and information misuse. As such, Facebook users face the dilemma of benefiting from HI sharing and risking their privacy. In this work, we investigate HI sharing practices, preferences, and risk perceptions among Facebook users. We interviewed 21 participants with chronic health conditions to identify the key factors that influence users’ motivation to share HI on Facebook. We then conducted an online survey with 492 Facebook users in order to validate, refine, and extend our findings. While some factors related to sharing HI were found in literature, we provide a deeper understanding of the main factors that influenced users’ motivation to share HI on Facebook. The results suggest that the gained benefits from prior HI sharing experiences, and users’ overall attitudes toward privacy, correlate with their motivation to disclose HI. Furthermore, we identify other factors, specifically users’ perceived health and the audience of the shared HI, that appear to be linked with users’ motivation to share HI. Finally, we suggest design improvements— such as anonymous identity as well as search and recommendation features—for facilitating HI sharing on Facebook and similar sites.",

We conducted three online user studies focused on privacy notice design for fitness wearables. Our results indicate that short-form privacy notices can inform users about privacy practices. However, we found no effect from including positive or negative framing in our notices. Finally, we found that removing expected privacy practices from notices sometimes led to less awareness of those practices, without improving awareness of the practices that remained in the shorter notices. Given that shorter notices are typically expected to be more effective, we find the lack of increased awareness of the practices remaining in the notice surprising. Our results suggest that the length of an effective privacy notice may be bounded.

Results suggest that penetration tests improve developers’ security awareness, but long-lasting change of development practices is hampered if security is not properly reflected in the communicative and collaborative structures of the organization, e.g. by a dedicated stakeholder.

This concern is especially prevalent in security information workers sensitized to mobile technology vulnerabilities by information about security risk. The purpose of this study is to better understand the mental models and practices of those security conscious users from academia, industry, and government, from an explorative qualitative approach, noting that mobile authentication studies have largely overlooked the mindset of users who have considered their behavior in terms of detailed knowledge of risk. A preliminary analysis of findings is presented in this paper. Participants described usability and situational impairment issues, and concern for data security arising from highly contextual combinations of technology and situational risk. Implications for development of security methods derived from these views are discussed, such as the need for authentication rigor to be driven by more contextualized understanding of task and location-based risk.

CARINA is a collaborative investigation system that aids in decision making by co-locating the analysis environment with centralized cyber data sources, and providing next generation analysts with increased visibility to the work of others. In current generation cyber work, tools limit analyst’s ability to collaborate, often relying on individual record keeping which hinders their ability to reflect on their own work and transition analytic insights to others. While online collaboration technologies have been shown to encourage and facilitate information sharing and group decision making in multiple contexts, no such technology exists today in cyber. Using visualization and annotation, CARINA leverages conversation and ad hoc thought to coordinate decisions across an organization. CARINA incorporates features designed to incentivize positive information-sharing behaviors, and provides a framework for incorporating recommendation engines and other analytics to guide analysts in the discovery of related data or analyses. In this paper, we present the user research that informed the development of CARINA, discuss the functionality of the system, and outline potential use cases. We also discuss future research trajectories and implications for cyber researchers and practitioners.",

Sadly, they often result in users' passwords exhibiting new, yet still predictable, patterns. In this paper, we investigate the usability and security of adaptive password-composition policies, which dynamically change password requirements over time as users create new passwords. We conduct a 2,619- participant between-subjects online experiment to evaluate the strength and usability of passwords created with two adaptive password policies. We also design and test a feedback system that guides users to successfully create a password conforming to these policies. We find that a well-configured, structure-based adaptive password policy can significantly increase password strength with little to no decrease in usability. We discuss how system administrators can use these results to improve password diversity.",

Our findings indicate that while the website features mostly retain their predicting power for the US sample, only one feature affecting PCP strength translates to the German sample: whether users can choose among multiple alternative websites providing the same service.

Unfortunately, evidence to date suggests users are unable to do this. Accordingly, we study in detail how well users can locate and complete the authentication ceremony when they are aware of the need for authentication. We execute a two-phase study involving 36 pairs of participants, using three popular messaging applications with support for secure messaging functionality: WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger. The first phase included instruction about potential threats, while the second phase also included instructions about the importance of the authentication ceremony. We find that, across the three apps, the average success rates of finding and completing the authentication ceremony increases from 14% to 79% from the first to second phase, with second-phase success rates as high as 96% for Viber. However, the time required to find and complete the ceremony is undesirably long from a usability standpoint, and our data is inconclusive on whether users make the connection between this ceremony and the security guarantees it brings. We discuss in detail the success rates, task timings, and user feedback for each application, as well as common mistakes and user grievances.

In this paper, we argue that lack of risk awareness plays an important role behind many users’ insecure behavior rather than inconvenience, which can be addressed by communicating risks more effectively. To test this hypothesis, we designed an informational video explaining the risks of unauthorized access to smartphones with no screen lock. We compared a control group (n = 114) to a treatment group that viewed the video (n = 114) in terms of risk perceptions, concerns, and attitudes towards secure screen lock methods. Subsequently, a follow-up study was conducted to see whether the video was effective in changing participants’ behavior or not (i.e., enabling a secure screen lock). We found statistically significant differences between treatment and control group participants in terms of perceived severity, risk awareness, response cost, and privacy and security concerns. Furthermore, the follow-up study revealed that significantly more participants in the treatment group enabled a secure screen lock than those in the control group (48/96 (50%) vs. 21/98 (21%), respectively).

Consumers are transforming their homes into smart homes, with internet-connected sensors, lights, appliances, and locks, controlled by voice or other user-defined automations. Security experts have identified concerns with IoT and smart homes, including privacy risks as well as vulnerable and unreliable devices. These concerns are supported by recent high profile attacks, such as the Mirai DDoS attacks. However, little work has studied the security and privacy concerns of end users who actually set up and interact with today’s smart homes. To bridge this gap, we conduct semi-structured interviews with fifteen people living in smart homes (twelve smart home administrators and three other residents) to learn about how they use their smart homes, and to understand their security and privacy related attitudes, expectations, and actions. Among other findings, we identify gaps in threat models arising from limited technical understanding of smart homes, awareness of some security issues but limited concern, ad hoc mitigation strategies, and a mismatch between the concerns and power of the smart home administrator and other people in the home. From these and other findings, we distill recommendations for smart home technology designers and future research.",

Recruiting these professionals for user studies can prove challenging, as, relative to end users more generally, they are limited in numbers, geographically concentrated, and accustomed to higher compensation. One potential approach is to recruit active GitHub users, who are (in some ways) conveniently available for online studies. However, it is not well understood how GitHub users perform when working on security-related tasks. As a first step in addressing this question, we conducted an experiment in which we recruited 307 active GitHub users to each complete the same securityrelevant programming tasks. We compared the results in terms of functional correctness as well as security, finding differences in performance for both security and functionality related to the participant’s self-reported years of experience, but no statistically significant differences related to the participant’s self-reported status as a student, status as a professional developer, or security background.

These \"mobile money\" services have proven extremely successful in their first ten years of deployment, and provide a powerful means of raising people out of poverty. Such services have access to a wealth of customer information, potentially including entire purchase histories, geolocation, and social network information. In this paper, we perform the first study of privacy policies in mobile money services, evaluating policies from 54 services and comparing them to 50 policies from traditional financial institutions. Because mobile money services are developed under a wide range of regulatory environments, we compare policies to the industry standard (the GSMA's Mobile Privacy Principles) and to a traditional national standard (the FDIC's Privacy Rule Handbook). Our analysis shows that almost half (44%) of these mobile money services do not have any privacy policy whatsoever. Of the services that do have privacy policies, roughly one-third (33%) fail to provide them in either of the two most common languages of their market. Furthermore, 50% of these policies do not ever identify to the user what data is actually being collected and stored. Finally, we find that where policies do exist, they are often incomplete and difficult to read by their target customers. These findings show that more work is needed to protect consumer privacy within these mobile money services.",

These services depend entirely on the mobile phone network as their carrier, so they stop where the network does. This leaves millions of the very poorest people stranded – people living in remote areas where there is little to no network service. It also leaves urban users at the mercy of network congestion. We developed a prototype system, DigiTally, which lets users make offline payments by copying short strings of digits from one mobile handset to another. Offline payments are already used for electricity (both in prepayment meters and pay-asyou-go solar); can we extend them into a general-purpose payment system, to increase service resilience in the face of network congestion or outage, and provide service to currently excluded areas? We report the results of a preliminary study with an early prototype of DigiTally, tested on participants from a university in Nairobi (Kenya). The code-sharing process presented a possible usability challenge. To explore this and other aspects of an early prototype, DigiTally was introduced to Kenyan participants in order to resolve any major issues before a later field trial. We discuss the lessons learned from our field visits and initial evaluation; we hope that this contribution is helpful for researchers and policy makers interested in mobile payments and financial inclusion. We also present our findings and observations. We found that, although offline payments involve copying codes in both directions between the payer’s phone and the payee’s, the extra workload was acceptable to most users.

Prior research has shown how these interfaces are insufficient from a usability standpoint: they do not account for context. In allowing for more contextual decisions, machine-learning techniques have shown great promise for designing systems that automatically make privacy decisions on behalf of the user. However, if such decisions are made automatically, then feedback mechanisms are needed to empower users to both audit those decisions and correct any errors. In this paper, we describe our user-centered approach towards designing a fully functional privacy feedback interface for the Android platform. We performed two large-scale user studies to research the usability of our design. Our second, 580-person validation study showed that users of our new interface were significantly more likely to both understand and control the selected set of circumstances under which applications could access sensitive data when compared to the default Android privacy settings interface.",

Keystroke dynamics, or typing behavior, is a potentially rich source of biometric information for those that type frequently, and thus has been studied widely as an authenticator on touch-based mobile devices. However, the typingwhile-moving scenario that characterizes mobile device use may change keystroke-based patterns sufficiently that typing biometrics-based authentication may not be viable. This paper presents a user study on the effects of user movement while typing on the effectiveness of keystroke dynamics as an authenticator. Using the dynamic text-based keystroke timings of 36 study participants, we first show that näıvely measuring patterns without considering position (e.g., sitting, standing or walking while typing) results in generic patterns that are little better than chance. We show that first determining the user’s position before classifying their typing behavior, our two-phased approach, inferred the user’s position with an AUC of above 90%, and the user’s typing pattern was classified with an AUC of over 93%. Our results show that user typing patterns are a viable secondary or continuous post-PIN authentication method, even when movement changes a user’s typing pattern.",

Understanding whether there are commonalities amongst users who avoid auto-updates can help us create better mobile application updating interfaces. However, little is known about how users’ characteristics associate with their attitudes towards auto-updating their mobile applications, or how we can leverage these characteristics to encourage users to auto-update these applications to improve security. In this paper, by surveying Android users, we establish how users’ past experiences with software updating, and users’ psychometric traits differentiate those users who avoid application auto-updates from those who do them, as well as users’ preferences towards auto-updating their applications. Our findings reveal that users who avoid application auto-updates are more likely to have had past negative experiences with software updating, tend to take fewer risks, and display greater proactive security awareness. Users’ perceived level of trust with mobile applications also determined how comfortable they are auto-updating these applications. Based on these findings, we recommend how Android can improve the design of application update systems to encourage users to auto-update and keep their devices secure.",

We employ an experience sampling methodology in order to ask users the reasons inuencing their decisions immediately after they decide. We conducted a longitudinal survey with 157 participants over a 6 week period. \n \nWe explore the grant and denial rates of permissions, overall and on a per permission type basis. Overall, our participants accepted 84% of the permission requests. We observe differences in the denial rates across permissions types; these vary from 23% (for microphone) to 10% (calendar). We find that one of the main reasons for granting or denying a permission request depends on users' expectation on whether or not an app should need a permission. A common reason for denying permissions is because users know they can change them later. Among the permissions granted, our participants said they were comfortable with 90% of those decisions - indicating that for 10% of grant decisions users may be consenting reluctantly.

We present an experiment in which children at Dutch primary schools received an anti-phishing training. The subjects were subsequently tested for their ability to distinguish phishing from non-phishing. A control group was used to control for external effects. Furthermore, the subjects received a re-test after several weeks to measure how well the children retained the training. The training improved the children's overall score by 14%. The improvement was mostly caused by an increased score on the questions where they had to detect phishing. The score on recognizing legitimate emails was not affected by the training. We found that the improved phishing score returned to pre-training levels after four weeks. Conversely, the score of recognition of legitimate emails increased over time. After four weeks, trained pupils scored significantly better in recognizing legitimate emails than their untrained counterparts. Age had a positive effect on the score (i.e., older children scored higher than younger ones); but sex had no significant influence. In conclusion, educating children to improve their ability to detect phishing works in the short term only. However, children go to school regularly, making it easier to educate them than adults.

Folk theories are sets of beliefs and understandings that arise informally and guide decision-making. To investigate folk theories regarding sensor data collection that might guide privacy self-management decisions, we conducted qualitative free list activities with 30 activity tracker users in which we asked them to list \"information that an activity tracker knows\". We found that folk theories regarding the data that activity trackers collect depend on interactions between the users and their trackers that provide visibility into dependencies among data types, evidence about what trackers are able to record, and feedback that inspires speculation about how trackers work.

Users were asked to rate their confidence in their own judgements and these confidence scores were poorly calibrated with actual performance, particularly for phishing (as opposed to genuine) emails. We also examined the role of impulsive behaviour on phish detection, concluding that those who score highly on dysfunctional impulsivity are less likely to detect the presence of phishing emails.",

Specifically, we study the effect of a notice that makes individuals aware that a particular advertisement has been targeted to them on their attitudes about the product and intentions to purchase the product. We find that, among individuals who have negative opinions about the practice of targeted advertising, awareness about targeting significantly worsens attitudes towards the targeted product and reduces the likelihood of purchasing the targeted product. Among individuals who have positive and neutral opinions about targeted advertising, awareness about targeting does not impact attitudes or purchase intentions towards the targeted product. We develop a scale to measure opinions about targeted ads and find that a substantial proportion (at least 33%) of our participants have negative opinions about targeted ads. This suggests that the self-regulated advertising industry is not incentivized to follow recommendations from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to make consumers aware about their targeted advertising practices.",

Lenny is such a bot (a computer program) which plays a set of pre-recorded voice messages to interact with the spammers. Although not based on any sophisticated artificial intelligence, Lenny is surprisingly effective in keeping the conversation going for tens of minutes. Moreover, it is clearly recognized as a bot in only 5% of the calls recorded in our dataset. In this paper, we try to understand why Lenny is so successful in dealing with spam calls. To this end, we analyze the recorded conversations of Lenny with various types of spammers. Among 487 publicly available call recordings, we select 200 calls and transcribe them using a commercial service. With this dataset, we first explore the spam ecosystem captured by this chatbot, presenting several statistics on Lenny’s interaction with spammers. Then, we use conversation analysis to understand how Lenny is adjusted with the sequential context of such spam calls, keeping a natural flow of conversation. Finally, we discuss a range of research and design issues to gain a better understanding of chatbot conversations and to improve their efficiency.",

With our study, we aim to quantify the value which app users attribute to their friends’ information (i.e., value of interdependent privacy) and to understand how this valuation is affected by two factors: sharing anonymity (i.e., whether disclosure of friends’ information is anonymous), and context relevance (i.e., whether friends’ information is necessary for apps’ functionality). Specifically, we conduct a between-subject, choicebased conjoint analysis study with 4 treatment conditions (2 sharing anonymity × 2 context relevance). Our study confirms the important roles that sharing anonymity and context relevance play in the process of interdependent privacy valuation. In addition, we also investigate how other factors, e.g., individuals’ personal attributes and experiences, affect interdependent privacy valuations by applying structural equation modeling analysis. Our research findings yield design implications as well as contribute to policy discussions to better account for the problem of interdependent privacy.",

In the public spaces where autonomous vehicles operate there is little reasonable expectation of privacy and no notice or choice given, raising privacy questions. To improve the acceptance of networked autonomous vehicles and to facilitate the development of technological and policy mechanisms to protect privacy, public expectations and concerns must first be investigated. In a study (n=302) of residents in cities with and without Uber autonomous vehicle fleets, we explore people’s conceptions of the sensing and analysis capabilities of self-driving vehicles; their comfort with the different capabilities; and the effort, if any, to which they would be willing to go to opt out of data collection. We find that 54% of participants would spend more than five minutes using an online system to opt out of identifiable data collection. In addition, secondary use scenarios such as recognition, identification, and tracking of individuals and their vehicles were associated with low likelihood ratings and high discomfort. Surprisingly, those who thought secondary use scenarios were more likely were more comfortable with those scenarios.

In two experiments, we manipulate the content as well as the format of privacy notices shown to participants who were asked to choose whether they would like to disclose personal information. We manipulate content by changing the objective privacy risk that participants face from disclosing personal information. We manipulate format by changing the manner in which these notices are presented. We find that participants are significantly less likely to share their personal information when the privacy notice is presented under a ‘Prohibit [disclosure]’ frame, as compared to an ‘Allow [disclosure]’ frame. However, and importantly, we find that the effect of changes in framing on disclosure decisions is small when the objective privacy risk from disclosure is low, but the effect of framing becomes larger when the risk is increased—that is, for potentially more sensitive decisions. Our results highlight the nuanced interaction effects between the objective content of privacy notices and the manner in which they are presented, on disclosure behavior.",

To develop these tools, it is important to better understand how people feel about the privacy implications of IoT and the situations in which they prefer to be notified about data collection. We report on a 1,007-participant vignette study focusing on privacy expectations and preferences as they pertain to a set of 380 IoT data collection and use scenarios. Participants were presented with 14 scenarios that varied across eight categorical factors, including the type of data collected (e.g. location, biometrics, temperature), how the data is used (e.g., whether it is shared, and for what purpose), and other attributes such as the data retention period. Our findings show that privacy preferences are diverse and context dependent; participants were more comfortable with data being collected in public settings rather than in private places, and are more likely to consent to data being collected for uses they find beneficial. They are less comfortable with the collection of biometrics (e.g. fingerprints) than environmental data (e.g. room temperature, physical presence). We also find that participants are more likely to want to be notified about data practices that they are uncomfortable with. Finally, our study suggests that after observing individual decisions in just three data-collection scenarios, it is possible to predict their preferences for the remaining scenarios, with our model achieving an average accuracy of up to 86%.",

A common defense is ratelimiting, either by slowing down or blocking connections, or by requiring CAPTCHAs to be solved. Either of these options has serious drawbacks, facilitating denial of service attacks, being circumventable by proxies and CAPTCHA solving services, and offering bad usability to the legitimate user. Furthermore, guessing attacks are becoming increasingly easier, fueled by recent data breaches containing several hundred million credentials from famous websites. In this work-in-progress report, we propose an opt-in depositbased approach to rate-limiting that tackles online guessing attacks. By demanding a small deposit for each login attempt, which is immediately refunded after a successful sign in, online guessing attackers face high costs for repeated unsuccessful logins. We provide an initial analysis of suitable payment systems and reasonable deposit values for realworld implementations and discuss security and usability implications of the system.",

The presence of multiple pieces of mobile technology complicates the question of how to secure them. Utilizing different authentication solutions on different devices may create usability challenges, while using the same authentication technique on more than one device raises the possibility of a compromise of one device affecting the others. Behavioral biometrics, which model the manner in which users interact with their devices, are an appealing option for a single authentication mechanism solution which is capable of working across different devices. Whether or not a user’s behavioral features are specific to a particular device is an open question, however. Intuitively, a user’s behavior should be independent of what device they are using. In practice, however, this behavior may be impacted by device hardware and software characteristics such as form factor and virtual keyboard layout. This paper presents an initial investigation into whether or not biometric touchscreen profiles (i.e., trained classification models which can be utilized to authenticate users to their devices) can be applied across more than one mobile device. We conduct a preliminary IRB-approved investigation in which 10 users were asked to perform 3 common tasks on 3 different mobile devices: reading, typing, and playing a game. We then applied the well-known Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm to touchscreen features collected during each task. The results of this small-scale study indicate that user behavior is consistent for gameplay and reading across different types of mobile hardware, but different for typing. This provides preliminary evidence that it is possible to apply behavior-based authentication across multiple devices in some, but not all, contexts.",

For example, due to the large number and high complexity required of passwords, users frequently reuse and choose weak passwords. One way to address these problems is to centralize password management by using a password manager or single sign-on. While this centralizing approach can improve a user’s security, it also magnifies the damage caused by a compromise of the user’s master password. In this paper, we describe a new approach to enhance centralized password management using application-specific passwords. This approach prevents the compromise of a master password from immediately compromising all associated applications and instead, requires the attacker to conduct further online attacks against individual applications. We detail five possible system designs for application-specific passwords and describe our plans for user studies to test the acceptance and usability of this approach.",

The security of these systems is paramount as evidenced by high profile attacks such as those against Iran’s nuclear facilities and the Ukrainian Power Grid. Existing research has largely focused on technical measures against such attacks and little attention has been given to the security challenges and complexities arising from non-technical factors. For instance, cyber security workers need to maintain security whilst satisfying the demands of varied stakeholders such as managers, control engineers, enterprise IT personnel and field site operators. Existing ICS models, such as the Purdue model, tend to abstract away such complexities. In this paper, we report on initial findings from interviews with 25 industry operatives in the UK and Italy. Our analysis shows that the varying demands of various stakeholders in an ICS represent many complexities that we term grey area.

Yet too often these tools do not structure the presentation of that data to support the communication and decision making needs of a variety of stakeholders within an organization. For example, consider the task of fixing system vulnerabilities based on network scans. Network vulnerability tools produce an overwhelming amount of raw data that is difficult to prioritize. The most critical vulnerabilities in the most sensitive systems must be addressed quickly, before attackers discover and exploit them. Additionally, non-security domain experts are often called upon to perform remediation and/or to make critical security decisions. As such, it is imperative that the security state of the network be communicated in such a way as to support these efforts. Unfortunately, current security tools that provide visualizations are complex and fail to provide actionable data. In this paper, we propose a new way to visualize vulnerability scan data by network zone using free and open-source tools to demonstrate how visualizations can be created to support decision making.",

Yet, current notice and choice mechanisms, such as privacy policies, are often ineffective because they are neither usable nor useful, and are therefore ignored by users. Constrained interfaces on mobile devices, wearables, and smart home devices connected in an Internet of Things exacerbate the issue. Much research has studied usability issues of privacy notices and many proposals for more usable privacy notices exist. Yet, there is little guidance for designers and developers on the design aspects that can impact the effectiveness of privacy notices. In this paper, we make multiple contributions to remedy this issue. We survey the existing literature on privacy notices and identify challenges, requirements, and best practices for privacy notice design. Further, we map out the design space for privacy notices by identifying relevant dimensions. This provides a taxonomy and consistent terminology of notice approaches to foster understanding and reasoning about notice options available in the context of specific systems. Our systemization of knowledge and the developed design space can help designers, developers, and researchers identify notice and choice requirements and develop a comprehensive notice concept for their system that addresses the needs of different audiences and considers the system's limitations and opportunities for providing notice.",

Lay people, as compared to those with computer science or related backgrounds, had simpler mental models that omitted Internet levels, organizations, and entities. People with more articulated technical models perceived more privacy threats, possibly driven by their more accurate understanding of where specific risks could occur in the network. Despite these differences, we did not find a direct relationship between people's technical background and the actions they took to control their privacy or increase their security online.

Previous studies have suggested that this is due to the lack of usability and understanding of existing systems such as PGP. A recent study by Ruoti et al. suggested that transparent, standalone encryption software that shows ciphertext and allows users to manually participate in the encryption process is more trustworthy than integrated, opaque software and just as usable. In this work, we critically examine this suggestion by revisiting their study, deliberately investigating the effect of integration and transparency on users’ trust. We also implement systems that adhere to the OpenPGP standard and use end-to-end encryption without reliance on third-party key escrow servers. We find that while approximately a third of users do in fact trust standalone encryption applications more than browser extensions that integrate into their webmail client, it is not due to being able to see and interact with ciphertext. Rather, we find that users hold a belief that desktop applications are less likely to transmit their personal messages back to the developer of the software. We also find that despite this trust difference, users still overwhelmingly prefer integrated encryption software, due to the enhanced user experience it provides. Finally, we provide a set of design principles to guide the development of future consumerfriendly end-to-end encryption tools.",

We then interviewed them about their general strategies and inspirations. Most participants had a well-defined process for creating passwords. In some cases, participants consciously made weak passwords. In other cases, however, weak passwords resulted from misconceptions, such as the belief that adding \"!\" to the end of a password instantly makes it secure or that words that are difficult to spell are more secure than easy-tospell words. Participants commonly anticipated only very targeted attacks, believing that using a birthday or name is secure if those data are not on Facebook.

The need to develop research methods that provide a lens on personal experiences has driven much recent work in human-computer interaction, but has so far received little focus in usable security. In this paper we explore the potential of the micro blogging site Twitter to provide experience-centered insights into security practices. Taking the topic of passwords as an example, we collected tweets with the goal to capture personal narratives of password use situated in its context. We performed a qualitative content analysis on the tweets and uncovered: how tweets contained critique and frustration about existing password practices and workarounds; how people socially shared and revoked their passwords as a deliberate act in exploring and defining their relationships with others; practices of playfully bypassing passwords mechanisms and how passwords are appropriated in portrayals of self. These findings begin to evidence the extent to which passwords increasingly serve social functions that are more complex than have been documented in previous research.",

System-assigned passwords provide higher security, and thus in commercially deployed graphical-password systems (e.g., Passfaces), images are randomly assigned by the system. It is difficult, however, for many users to remember system-assigned passwords. We argue that this is because existing password schemes do not fully leverage humans’ cognitive strengths, and we thus examine techniques to enhance password memorability that incorporate scientific understanding of long-term memory. In our study, we examine the efficacy ofspatial cues (fixed position of images), verbal cues (phrases/facts related to the images), and employing user interaction (learning images through writing a short description at registration) to improve the memorability of passwords based on face images and object images. We conducted a multi-session in-lab user study with 56 participants, where each participant was assigned seven different graphical passwords, each representing one study condition. One week after registration, participants had a 98% login success rate for a scheme offering spatial and verbal cues, while the scheme based on user interaction had a 95% login success rate for face images and a 93% login success rate for object images. All of these were significantly higher than the control conditions representing existing graphical password schemes. These findings contribute to our understanding of the impact of cues and user interaction on graphical passwords, and they show a promising direction for future research to gain high memorability for system-assigned random passwords.",

The increased security we get from using system-generated PINs, however, comes at the cost of memorability. And while banks are increasingly adopting systemgenerated PINs, the impact on memorability of such PINs has not been studied. We conducted a large-scale online user study with 9,114 participants to investigate the impact of increased PIN length on the memorability of PINs, and whether number chunking 1 techniques (breaking a single number into multiple smaller numbers) can be applied to improve memorability for larger PIN lengths. As one would expect, our study shows that system-generated 4-digit PINs outperform 6-, 7-, and 8-digit PINs in long-term memorability. Interestingly, however, we find that there is no statistically significant difference in memorability between 6-, 7-, and 8-digit PINs, indicating that 7-, and 8-digit PINs should also be considered when looking to increase PIN length to 6-digits from currently common length of 4-digits for improved security. By grouping all 6-, 7-, and 8-digit chunked PINs together, and comparing them against a group of all non-chunked PINs, we find that chunking, overall, improves memorability of system-generated PINs.

To address this challenge, this paper investigates the possibility of using hints that may help users to recall recent day-to-day events more easily and explores various design alternatives for generating hints. Specifically, in this paper, we generate challenge questions and hints for three different kinds of autobiographical data (e.g., call logs, SMS logs, and location logs), and evaluate the effect of different question types and hint types on user performance by conducting a real-life study with 24 users over a 30 day period. To test whether hints are useful/harmful for adversaries’ response accuracy, we simulate various kinds of adversaries (e.g., naive and knowledgeable) by recruiting volunteers in pairs (e.g., close friends, significant others). In our study, we observed that, for legitimate users, hint was effective for all different question types.

These mechanisms disclose information about use of privacy-sensitive resources such as user location or contact list. However, it has been reported that very few users pay attention to these mechanisms during installation. Instead, a user may focus on a more user-friendly source of information: text description, which is written by a developer who has an incentive to attract user attention. When a user searches for an app in a marketplace, his/her query keywords are generally searched on text descriptions of mobile apps. Then, users review the search results, often by reading the text descriptions; i.e., text descriptions are associated with user expectation. Given these observations, this paper aims to address the following research question: What are the primary reasons that text descriptions of mobile apps fail to refer to the use of privacy-sensitive resources? To answer the research question, we performed empirical large-scale study using a huge volume of apps with our ACODE (Analyzing COde and DEscription) framework, which combines static code analysis and text analysis. We developed light-weight techniques so that we can handle hundred of thousands of distinct text descriptions. We note that our text analysis technique does not require manually labeled descriptions; hence, it enables us to conduct a large-scale measurement study without requiring expensive labeling tasks. Our analysis of 200,000 apps and multilingual text descriptions collected from official and third-party Android marketplaces revealed four primary factors that are associated with the inconsistencies between text descriptions and the use of privacy-sensitive resources: (1) existence of app building services/frameworks that tend to add API permissions/code unnecessarily, (2) existence of prolific developers who publish many ap",

To protect such data, all mobile OSs have a phone lock mechanism, a mechanism that requires user authentication before granting access to applications and data on the phone. iPhone’s unlocking secret (a.k.a., passcode in Apple’s terminology) is also used to derive a key for encrypting data on the device. Recently, Apple has introduced Touch ID, that allows a fingerprint-based authentication to be used for unlocking an iPhone. The intuition behind the technology was that its usability would allow users to use stronger passcodes for locking their iOS devices, without substantially sacrificing usability. To this date, it is unclear, however, if users take advantage of Touch ID technology and if they, indeed, employ stronger passcodes. It is the main objective and the contribution of this paper to fill this knowledge gap. In order to answer this question, we conducted three user studies (a) an in-person survey with 90 participants, (b) interviews with 21 participants, and (c) an online survey with 374 Amazon Mechanical Turks. Overall, we found that users do not take an advantage of Touch ID and use weak unlocking secrets, mainly 4-digit PINs, similarly to those users who do not use Touch ID. To our surprise, we found that more than 30% of the participants in each group did not know that they could use passwords instead of 4-digit PINs. Some other participants indicated that they adopted PINs due to better usability, in comparison to passwords. Most of the participants agreed that Touch ID, indeed, offers usability benefits, such as convenience, speed and ease of use. Finally, we found that there is a disconnect between users’ desires for security that their passcodes have to offer and the reality. In particular, only 12% of participants correctly estimated the security their passcodes provide.",

To address users’ tendency to choose guessable PINs and patterns, we compare two approaches for helping users learn assigned random secrets. In one approach, built on our prior work [16], we assign users a second numeric PIN and, during each login, we require them to enter it after their chosen PIN. In a new approach, we re-arrange the digits on the keypad so that the user’s chosen PIN appears on an assigned random sequence of key positions. We performed experiments with over a thousand participants to compare these two repetition-learning approaches to simple user-chosen PINs and assigned PINs that users are required to learn immediately at account set-up time. Almost all of the participants using either repetition-learning approach learned their assigned secrets quickly and could recall them three days after the study. Those using the new mapping approach were less likely to write down their secret. Surprisingly, the learning process was less time consuming for those required to enter an extra PIN.",

We found demographic differences in both beliefs about security and security behaviors that pose challenges for helping users become more informed about security.

The success of a SOC depends on having the right tools, processes and, most importantly, efficient and effective analysts. One of the worrying issues in recent times has been the consistently high burnout rates of security analysts in SOCs. Burnout results in analysts making poor judgments when analyzing security events as well as frequent personnel turnovers. In spite of high awareness of this problem, little has been known so far about the factors leading to burnout. Various coping strategies employed by SOC management such as career progression do not seem to address the problem but rather deal only with the symptoms. In short, burnout is a manifestation of one or more underlying issues in SOCs that are as of yet unknown. In this work we performed an anthropological study of a corporate SOC over a period of six months and identified concrete factors contributing to the burnout phenomenon. We use Grounded Theory to analyze our fieldwork data and propose a model that explains the burnout phenomenon. Our model indicates that burnout is a human capital management problem resulting from the cyclic interaction of a number of human, technical, and managerial factors. Specifically, we identified multiple vicious cycles connecting the factors affecting the morale of the analysts. In this paper we provide detailed descriptions of the various vicious cycles and suggest ways to turn these cycles into virtuous ones. We further validated our results on the fieldnotes from a SOC at a higher education institution. The proposed model is able to successfully capture and explain the burnout symptoms in this other SOC as well.",

We then extended their research by conducting a similar field observation study in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Moreover, in addition to observing ATM users (withdrawing), we also observed electronic payment scenarios requiring PIN entry. Altogether, we gathered data related to 930 observations. Similar to De Luca et al., we conducted follow-up interviews, the better to interpret our findings. We were able to confirm De Luca et al.’s findings with respect to low PIN shielding incidence during ATM cash withdrawals, with no significant differences between shielding rates across the three countries. PIN shielding incidence during electronic payment scenarios was significantly lower than incidence during ATM withdrawal scenarios in both the United Kingdom and Sweden. Shielding levels in Germany were similar during both withdrawal and payment scenarios. We conclude the paper by suggesting a number of explanations for the differences in shielding that our study revealed.",

We conducted two surveys on Mechanical Turk through which we examined people’s self-reported behaviors in using and updating workplace passwords, and their attitudes toward four previously studied password management behaviors, including periodic password changes. Our findings suggest that forced password expiration might not have some of the negative effects that were feared nor positive ones that were hoped for. In particular, our results indicate that participants forced to change passwords did not resort to behaviors that would significantly decrease password security; on the other hand, their self-reported strategies for creating replacement passwords suggest that those passwords were no stronger than the ones they replaced. We also found that repeating security advice causes users to internalize it, even if evidence supporting the advice is scant. Our participants overwhelmingly reported that periodically changing passwords was important for account security, though not as important as other factors that have been more convincingly shown to influence password strength.",

This has resulted in proposals for securing data in the home built on interdisciplinary theories and models, but more empirical research needs to be done to understand the practical context, characteristics, and needs of home users in order to rigorously evaluate and inform solutions to home data security. To address this, we employ a two-part study to explore issues that influence or affect security practices in the home. In the first part, we conduct a qualitative Grounded Theory analysis of 65 semi-structured interviews aimed at uncovering the key factors in home user security practices, and in the second part we conduct a quantitative survey of 1128 participants to validate and generalise our initial findings. We found evidence that security practices in the home are affected by survival/outcome bias; social relationships serve as informal support networks for security in the home; and that people look for continuity of care when they seek or accept security support.",

While prior research has shown that these extensions suffer from several usability issues, we know little about real world blocking extension use, why users choose to adopt these extensions, and how effectively these extensions protect users against online tracking. To study these questions, we conducted two online surveys examining both users and non-users of blocking extensions. We have three main findings. First, we show both users and non-users of these extensions only possess a basic understanding of online tracking, and that participants’ mental models only weakly correlate with their behavior to adopt these extensions. Second, we find that that each type of blocking extension has a specific primary use associated with it. Finally, we find that users report that extensions only rarely break websites. However when websites break, users only disable their extensions if they trust and are familiar with the website.

Face-morphs are images digitally created by combining facial pictures of different individuals. In the case of self-morphs, a person’s own picture is combined with that of another individual. Prior research has shown that even when individuals do not recognize themselves in self-morphs, they tend to trust self-morphed faces more, and judge them more favorably. Thus, self-morphs may be used online as covert forms of targeted marketing – for instance, using consumers’ pictures from social media streams to create self-morphs, and inserting the resulting self-morphs in promotional campaigns targeted at those consumers. The usage of this type of personal data for highly targeted influence without individuals' awareness, and the type of opaque effect such artifacts may have on individuals' attitudes and behaviors, raise potential issues of consumer privacy and autonomy. However, no research to date has examined the feasibility of using self-morphs for such applications. Research on self-morphs has focused on artificial laboratory settings, raising questions regarding the practical, in-the-wild applicability of reported self-morph effects. In three experiments, we examine whether self-morphs could affect individuals' attitudes or even promote products/services, using a combination of experimental designs and dependent variables. Across the experiments, we test both designs and variables that had been used in previous research in this area and new ones that had not. Questioning prior research, however, we find no evidence that end-users react more positively to self-morphs than control-morphs composed of unfamiliar facial pictures in either attitudes or actual behaviors.",

These practices involved management of phone and app locks, content deletion, technology avoidance, and use of private modes. We present design opportunities for maintaining privacy on shared devices that are mindful of the social norms and values in the South Asian countries studied, including to improve discovery of privacy controls, offer content hiding, and provide algorithmic understanding of multiple-user use cases.

We further propose a set of design directions that address our users’ current workarounds at each stage. We argue for a holistic perspective on privacy management that considers workarounds across all these stages. In particular, designs for privacy need to more equitably distribute the technical power of determining what happens with and to a photo among all the stakeholders of the photo, including subjects and bystanders, rather than the photographer alone.",

We explored discrepancies between observed and self-reported private behaviors through a follow-up survey, distributed to both Mechanical Turk and SBO participants. The survey also allowed us to investigate why private browsing is used for certain activities. Our findings reveal that people use private browsing for practical and security reasons, beyond the expected privacy reasons. Additionally, the primary use cases for private browsing were consistent across the reported and empirical data, though there were discrepancies in how frequently private browsing is used for online activities.

Since stand-alone notifications are routinely ignored, some ISPs have invested in a potentially more effective mechanism: quarantining customers in so-called walled gardens. We present the first empirical study on user behavior and remediation effectiveness of quarantining infected machines in broadband networks. We analyzed 1,736 quarantining actions involving 1,208 retail customers of a medium-sized ISP in the period of April-October 2017. The first two times they are quarantined, users can easily release themselves from the walled garden and around two-thirds of them use this option. Notwithstanding this easy way out, we find that 71% of these users have actually cleaned up the infection during their first quarantine period and, of the recidivists, 48% are cleaned after their second quarantining. Users who do not self-release either contact customer support (30%) or are released automatically after 30 days (3%). They have even higher cleanup rates. Reinfection rates are quite low and most users get quarantined only once. Users that remain infected spend less time in the walled garden during subsequent quarantining events, without a major drop in cleanup rates. This suggests there are positive learning effects, rather than mere habituation to being notified and self-releasing from the walled garden. In the communications with abuse and support staff, a fraction of quarantined users ask for additional help, request a paid technician, voice frustration about being cut off, or threaten to cancel their subscriptions. All in all, walled gardens seem to be a relatively effective and usable mechanism to improve the security of end users. We reflect on our main findings in terms of how to advance this industry best practice for botnet mitigation by ISPs.",

In many cases developers are overburdened by the complex set of programming choices and their security implications. Past studies have identified significant challenges when using cryptographic APIs that lack a certain set of usability features (e. g. easy-to-use documentation or meaningful warning and error messages) leading to an especially high likelihood of writing functionally correct but insecure code. To support software developers in writing more secure code, this work investigates a novel approach aimed at these hardto-use cryptographic APIs. In a controlled online experiment with 53 participants, we study the effectiveness of API-integrated security advice which informs about an API misuse and places secure programming hints as guidance close to the developer. This allows us to address insecure cryptographic choices including encryption algorithms, key sizes, modes of operation and hashing algorithms with helpful documentation in the guise of warnings. Whenever possible, the security advice proposes code changes to fix the responsible security issues. We find that our approach significantly improves code security. 73% of the participants who received the security advice fixed their insecure code. We evaluate the opportunities and challenges of adopting API-integrated security advice and illustrate the potential to reduce the negative implications of cryptographic API misuse and help developers write more secure code.",

One potential source of these vulnerabilities is shortcomings in the used language and library APIs. Developers tend to trust APIs, but can misunderstand or misuse them, introducing vulnerabilities. We call the causes of such misuse blindspots. In this paper, we study API blindspots from the developers’ perspective to: (1) determine the extent to which developers can detect API blindspots in code and (2) examine the extent to which developer characteristics (i.e., perception of code correctness, familiarity with code, confidence, professional experience, cognitive function, and personality) affect this capability. We conducted a study with 109 developers from four countries solving programming puzzles that involve Java APIs known to contain blindspots. We find that (1) The presence of blindspots correlated negatively with the developers’ accuracy in answering implicit security questions and the developers’ ability to identify potential security concerns in the code. This effect was more pronounced for I/O-related APIs and for puzzles with higher cyclomatic complexity. (2) Higher cognitive functioning and more programming experience did not predict better ability to detect API blindspots. (3) Developers exhibiting greater openness as a personality trait were more likely to detect API blindspots. This study has the potential to advance API security in (1) design, implementation, and testing of new APIs; (2) addressing blindspots in legacy APIs; (3) development of novel methods for developer recruitment and training based on cognitive and personality assessments; and (4) improvement of software development processes (e.g., establishment of security and functionality teams).",

We confirm that the two obfuscation methods have a measurable negative effect on program comprehension in general but also show that this effect inversely correlates with the programming experience of attackers. So while the comprehension effectiveness of experienced programmers is generally higher than for inexperienced programmers, the comprehension gap between these groups narrows considerably if source code obfuscation is used. In extension of previous work, an investigation of the code analysis behavior of attackers reveals that there exist obfuscation techniques that significantly impede comprehension even if tool support exists to revert them, giving first supportive empirical evidence for the classical distinction between potent and resilient obfuscation techniques defined by Collberg et al. more than 20 years ago.",

This mindset, in turn, guides the careful selection of cryptographic resources and informs formal, rigorous development and testing practices. The enhanced understanding of organizational practices encourages additional research initiatives to explore variations in those implementing cryptography, which can aid in transferring lessons learned from more security-mature organizations to the broader development community through educational opportunities, tools, and other mechanisms.

                    "abstract": "The adoption of encryption tools by the public has been advocated as a protective measure that would further both security and privacy aims. However, past work has shown that when users are actively involved in the encryption process, they can struggle to accomplish this task [1], [2], [3], [4]. This is a major obstacle to the practical adoption of encryption because mistakes involving encryption can have terrible consequences. Failures to use encryption tools correctly can result in a false sense of security or, perhaps worse still, unintentional and self-imposed denial of service when users lose access to precious accounts and data. When the impact of user error is severe, a natural response is to circumvent users entirely by transparently incorporating complex mechanisms into the software itself. Indeed, in contexts where encryption has successfully achieved widespread deployment—TLS/HTTPS, secure messengers, and smartphone encryption—this has been the approach taken; most users are not even aware encryption occurs in these systems. Unfortunately, while indeed effective, this approach is not without limitations [5], [6]. Automation is not always perfect, and even the best programmed software will occasionally require user input. Further exacerbating the issue, when a process has been sufficiently automated such that the user is not even aware of its presence, they will lack the context necessary to enact the correct response when interaction is required. To this point, in two of the cases where encryption has been transparently applied, research has shown users are indeed confused by resulting errors [7], [8]. In this work, we conduct a study focused on understanding what users perceive about encryption tools in situations where interaction is required but in which their knowledge is limited to knowing that encryption is somehow involved. More specifically, we present the first directed effort to explore users’ mental models—the representation of how one perceives something works—of encryption. We perform 19 semi-structured phone interviews with participants across the United States and examine three aspects of their mental models of encryption: what it is, how it works, and what role it plays in daily life. We find that participants’ models can be divided into four types which, while differing in structural details, boil down to functional abstractions of access control and symmetric encryption. We further observe highly varied opinions on the strength of encryption, opinions which do not appear to correlate with the detail or accuracy of participants’ models. Finally, we note that effort must be made with respect to conveying the utility of the personal use of encryption. More specifically, participants felt that service providers routinely employ encryption to protect their sensitive data, while the personal use of encryption was viewed as the domain of either illegal or immoral activity, or the paranoid.",

Cybersecurity advocates are security professionals who encourage and facilitate the adoption of these best practices. To be successful, they must motivate their audiences to engage in beneficial security behaviors, often first by overcoming negative perceptions that security is scary, confusing, and dull. However, there has been little prior research to explore how they do so. To address this gap, we conducted an interview study of 28 cybersecurity advocates from industry, higher education, government, and non-profits. Findings reveal that advocates must first establish trust with their audience and address concerns by being honest about risks while striving to be empowering. They address confusion by establishing common ground between security experts and non-experts, educating, providing practical recommendations, and promoting usable security solutions. Finally, to overcome perceptions that security is uninteresting, advocates incentivize behaviors and employ engaging communication techniques via multiple communication channels. This research provides insight into real-world security advocacy techniques in a variety of contexts, permitting an investigation into how advocates leverage general risk communication practices and where they have security-specific innovations. These practices may then inform the design of security interfaces and training. The research also suggests the value of establishing cybersecurity advocacy as a new work role within the security field.",

VR devices can use sensor data to draw deeply personal inferences (e.g., medical conditions, emotions) and can enable virtual crimes (e.g., theft, assault on virtual representations of the user) from which users have been shown to experience real, significant emotional pain. As such, VR may involve especially sensitive user data and interactions. To effectively mitigate such risks and design for safer experiences, we aim to understand end-user perceptions of VR risks and how, if at all, developers are considering and addressing those risks. In this paper, we present the first work on VR security and privacy perceptions: a mixed-methods study involving semi-structured interviews with 20 VR users and developers, a survey of VR privacy policies, and an ethics co-design study with VR developers. We establish a foundational understanding of perceived risks in VR; raise concerns about the state of VR privacy policies; and contribute a concrete VR developer \"code of ethics\", created by developers, for developers.",

True to the original hacker ethos, misinformation is seen as a threat to the democratic vision of the Internet, and as such, it must be confronted on the face with tried hacktivists' methods like deplatforming the\"misinformers\"and doxing or leaking data about their funding and recruitment. The majority of the hacktivists also recommended interventions for raising misinformation literacy in addition to targeted hacking campaigns.

Email service providers such as Gmail have tried to address this issue by deploying sender identity indicators (SIIs), which seek to raise users’ awareness about where a message originated and encourage safe behavior from users. However, the success of such indicators depends heavily on user interpretation and behavior, and there exists no work that empirically investigates these aspects. In this work, we conducted an interactive survey (n=180) that examined user comprehension of and behavior changes prompted by Gmail’s passive SII, the ‘via’ indicator. Our quantitative analysis shows that although most participants (89%) noticed the indicator, it did not have a significant impact on whether users would adopt safe behaviors. Additionally, our qualitative analysis suggests that once prompted to consider why ‘via’ is presented, the domain name displayed after ‘via’ heavily influenced participants’ interpretation of the message ‘via’ is communicating. Our work highlights the limitations of using passive indicators to assist users in making decisions about email messages with complicated provenance.",

Similarly, offline functionality is preferred over a feature to make direct payments between persons. Our findings suggest central banks to embrace a more user-centric design of CBDC. This effort should include communicating the key concepts and benefits to the potential users.",

However, user strategies to add cre-dentials, related obstacles, and their security implications are not well understood. To address this gap in security research, we performed a mixed-methods study, including expert reviews of 14 popular password managers and an online survey with 279 users of built-in and third-party password managers. We extend previous work by examining the status quo of password manager setup features and investigating password manager users’ setup strategies. We confirm previous research and find that many participants utilize password managers for convenience, not as a security tool. They most commonly add credentials whenever a website is visited, and prioritize what they add. Similarly, passwords are often only updated when they are considered insecure. Additionally, we observe a severe distrust towards password managers, leading to users not adding important passwords. We conclude our work by giving recommendations for password manager developers to help users overcome the obstacles we identified.",

Yet, little is published about what services do to prevent users from losing access to their accounts and how well users are guided through the process of regaining access to their accounts in case they lose their second factor. To fill this gap, we set up 2FA on 78 popular online services and apps and analyzed their user interface during the 2FA setup and recovery. Although there is no straightforward solution for account recovery when using a second factor, we identified easily fixable usability flaws. For example, in the setup phase, 28 services do not mention the possibility of losing the second factor at all. Furthermore, while it is common for services to provide a clearly visible “forgotten password”-link beneath the login field, an equivalent for 2FA is often missing, and a user is left alone with the problem.

Second, we prototyped the most common shapes and performed a one-week long in-the-wild study (N=15) to investigate how 2FA tangibles perform in different environments. We show that most users prefer objects that a) fit in wallets, b) connect to daily items or c) are standalone.

We ran a user study with 762 participants, and we found that an intervention guided by prospect theory -- which leverages the reference-dependence effect by framing selecting weak passwords as a loss relative to choosing a stronger password -- causes approximately 25% of users to improve the strength of their password (significantly more than alternative interventions) and reduced the final number of weak passwords by approximately 25%. We also evaluate the relation between user behavior and users' mental models of hacking and password attacks. These results provide guidance for designing and implementing account registration mechanisms that will significantly improve the strength of user-selected passwords, thereby leveraging insights from prospect theory to improve the security of systems that use password-based authentication.",

Experts and users alike struggle to prioritize and practice advised behaviours, negating both the advice’s purpose and potentially their security. While the problem is clear, no rigorous studies have established the root causes of overproduction, lack of prioritization, or other problems with security advice. Without understanding the causes, we cannot hope to remedy their effects. In this paper, we investigate the processes that authors follow to develop published security advice. In a semi-structured interview study with 21 advice writers, we asked about the authors’ backgrounds, advice creation processes in their organizations, the parties involved, and how they decide to review, update, or publish new content. Among the 17 themes we identified from our interviews, we learned that authors seek to cover as much content as possible, leverage multiple diverse external sources for content, typically only review or update content after major security events, and make few if any conscious attempts to deprioritize or curate less essential content. We recommend that researchers develop methods for curating security advice and guidance on messaging for technically diverse user bases and that authors then judiciously identify key messaging ideas and schedule periodic proactive content reviews. If implemented, these actionable recommendations would help authors and users both reduce the burden of advice overproduction while improving compliance with secure computing practices.

For instance, if two TAP rules have the same trigger condition, but one locks a door while the other unlocks it, the user may believe the door is locked when it is not. Researchers have developed tools to identify buggy or undesirable TAP programs, but little work investigates the usability of the different user-interaction approaches implemented by the various tools. This paper describes an exploratory study of the usability and utility of techniques proposed by TAP security analysis tools. We surveyed 447 Proliﬁc users to evaluate their ability to write declarative policies, identify undesirable patterns in TAP rules (anti-patterns), and correct TAP program errors, as well as to understand whether proposed tools align with users’ needs. We ﬁnd considerable variation in participants’ success rates writing policies and identifying anti-patterns. For some scenarios over 90% of participants wrote an appropriate policy, while for others nobody was successful. We also ﬁnd that participants did not necessarily perceive the TAP anti-patterns ﬂagged by tools as undesirable. Our work provides insight into real smart-home users’ goals, highlights the importance of more rigorous evaluation of users’ needs and usability issues when designing TAP security tools, and provides guidance to future tool development and TAP research.",

We employed an iterative, user-centered design process with 25 PVIs to design and evaluate GuardLens, a browser extension that improves the accessibility of privacy/security cues and helps PVIs assess a website’s legitimacy (i.e., if it is a spoof/phish). We started with a formative study to understand what privacy/security cues PVIs find helpful, and then improved GuardLens based on the results. Next, we further refined Guardlens based on a pilot study, and lastly, conducted our main study to evaluate GuardLens’ efficacy. The results suggest that GuardLens, by extracting and listing pertinent privacy/security cues in one place for faster and easier access, helps PVIs quickly and accurately determine if websites are legitimate or spoofs. PVIs found cues such as domain age, search result ranking, and the presence/absence of HTTPS encryption especially helpful. We conclude with design implications for tools to support PVIs with safe web browsing.",

We present a series of user studies that explored how both blind and sighted individuals use MetaMask, one of the most popular non-custodial crypto wallets. We uncovered inter-related accessibility, learnability, and security issues with MetaMask. We also report on an iterative redesign of MetaMask to make it more accessible for blind users. This process involved multiple evaluations with 44 novice crypto wallet users, including 20 sighted users, 23 blind users, and one user with low vision. Our study results show notable improvements for accessibility after two rounds of design iterations.

We conducted a four-week-long field study with 22 communities (101 participants) of friends, families, or co-workers who installed the CO-oPS app on their phones. Measures of transparency, trust, and awareness of one another's mobile privacy and security behaviors, along with individual and community participation in mobile privacy and security co-management, increased from pre- to post-study. Interview findings confirmed that the app features supported collective considerations of apps and permissions. However, participants expressed a range of concerns regarding having community members with different levels of technical expertise and knowledge regarding mobile privacy and security that can impact motivation to participate and perform oversight. Our study demonstrates the potential and challenges of community oversight mechanisms to support communities to co-manage mobile privacy and security.",

The results show both correlational and causal evidence that empirical expectations (beliefs about what others do) and normative expectations (beliefs about what others believe) inﬂuence choices to use mobile devices in ways that generate data that could be used to make sensitive inferences. However, participants also reported concern about data privacy, and lower behavioral intentions for vignettes involving more invasive inferences. Pluralistic ignorance is a phenomenon where individuals behave in ways they privately disagree with, because they see others around them behaving the same way and assume this is evidence most people approve of the behavior. These results are consistent with the existence of pluralistic ig-norance related to data privacy, and suggest that interventions focused on transparency about data practices are not enough to encourage people to make different privacy choices.",

However, the adoption of secure email remains low, with previous studies suggesting mainly that secure email is too complex or inconvenient to use. However, the perspectives of those who have, in fact, chosen to use an encrypted email system are largely overlooked. To understand these perspectives, we conducted a semi-structured interview study that aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mindsets underlying adoption and use of secure email services. Our participants come from a variety of countries and vary in the amount of time they have been using secure email, how often they use it, and whether they use it as their primary account. Our results uncover that a defining reason for adopting a secure email system is to avoid surveillance from big tech companies. However, regardless of the complexity and accuracy of a person’s mental model, our participants rarely send and receive encrypted emails, thus not making full use of the privacy they could obtain. These findings indicate that secure email systems could potentially find greater adoption by appealing to their privacy advantages, but privacy gains will be limited until a critical mass are able to join these systems and easily send encrypted emails to each other.",

In this paper, we conduct interviews with 16 users of E2EE platforms to understand users' mental models of how reporting works and their resultant privacy concerns and considerations surrounding reporting. We find that users expect platforms to store rich longitudinal reporting datasets, recognizing both their promise for better abuse mitigation and the privacy risk that platforms may exploit or fail to protect them. We also find that users have preconceptions about the respective capabilities and risks of moderators at the platform versus community level -- for instance, users trust platform moderators more to not abuse their power but think community moderators have more time to attend to reports. These considerations, along with perceived effectiveness of reporting and how to provide sufficient evidence while maintaining privacy, shape how users decide whether, to whom, and how much to report. We conclude with design implications for a more privacy-preserving reporting system on E2EE messaging platforms.",

Their popularity and ever-increasing relevance in our daily lives make these devices an integral part of our computing ecosystem. Yet, we know little about smartphone users and their security behaviors. In this paper, we report our development and testing of a new 14-item Smartphone Security Behavioral Scale (SSBS) which provides a measurement of users’ smartphone security behavior considering both technical and social strategies. For example, a technical strategy would be resetting the advertising ID while a social strategy would be downloading mobile applications only from an official source.The initial analysis of two-component behavioral model, based on technical versus social protection strategies, demonstrates high reliability and good fit for the social component of the behavioral scale. The technical component of the scale, which has theoretical significance, shows a marginal fit and could benefit from further improvement. This newly developed measure of smartphone security behavior is inspired by the theory of planned behavior and draws inspiration from a well-known scale of cybersecurity behavioral intention, the Security Behavior Intention Scale (SeBIS). The psychometrics of SSBS were established by surveying 1011 participants. We believe SSBS measures can enhance the understanding of human security behavior for both security researchers and HCI designers. ∗Hsiao-Ying Huang is best reachable at hhsiaoying@gmail.com Copyright is held by the author/owner.
