Digital image watermarking is an ideal solution since it protects the electronic patient information’s from unauthorized access. This paper presents a novel blind fragile-based image watermarking scheme in spatial domain that merges Speed Up Robust Features (SURF) descriptor with the well-known Weber Descriptors (WDs) and Arnold algorithm. It provides a good way for enhancing the image quality and time complexity for medical data integrity. Firstly, the watermark image is shuffled using Arnold chaotic map. Secondly, the SURF technique is practiced to Region of Interest (ROI) of the medical image and then the blocks around the SURF points are selected to insert the watermark. Finally, the watermark is encrusted and extracted using WDs. Experimental results show good image fidelity with the shortest execution time to ensure medical images integrity.",

There are problems in assessing the previous codebases in evaluating the developer-centric security vulnerability level of each developer. Thus, this paper suggests a method to evaluate this through the techno-behavioral features of their previous projects. Consequently, we present results of an exploratory study of the developer-centric security vulnerability level prediction using a dataset of 1827 developers by logically selecting 13 techno-behavioral features. Our results depict that there is a correlation between techno-behavioral features and developer-centric security vulnerability with 89.46% accuracy.

Furthermore, attackers may simulate FC situations to introduce undetected attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), since it is very difficult to distinguish between legitimate and malicious data flows. To differentiate malicious and legitimate traffic we propose applying zero inflated count data models in conjunction with the Correlation Coefficient Flow (CCF) method – a well-known method used in FC situations. Our results were satisfactory and improve the accuracy of CCF method. Furthermore, since the environment toggles between normal and FC situations, our method has the advantage of working in both situations.",

In particular, statistical and signature-based techniques do not allow detection of anomalies based on modifications of well-known attacks, dynamic approaches based on machine learning techniques result in false responses and frequent anomaly miss-outs. Therefore, various hybrid solutions are being frequently offered on the basis of those two approaches.

With existing systems limited and evolving, the objective of the current research work is to develop a robust Image Encryption technique that is adept and effective at handling heterogeneous data and can withstand state-of-the-art hacking efforts such as brute force attacks, cropping attacks, mathematical attacks, and differential attacks. The proposed Efficient DNA Cryptographic System (EDCS) model presents a pseudorandom substitution method using logistic sine cosine chaotic maps, wherein there is very little correlation between adjacent pixels, and it can decode the image with or without noise, thereby making the proposed system noise-agnostic. The proposed EDCS-based Image model using Chaotic Maps showed enhancements in parameters such as Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI), Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR), Histogram, and Entropy when compared with existing image security methods.",

This paper presented an improved model based on temporal convolutional networks (TCN) and attention mechanism. The causal and dilation convolution can capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of the data. The residual blocks allow the network to transfer information in a cross-layered manner, enabling in-depth network learning.

Hence, a deep learning model is intended to be developed in this paper using the meta-heuristic approach. The proposed model covers four main steps: (a) data acquisition, (b) pre-processing, (c) pattern extraction and (d) classification. The benchmark datasets regarding the face image with occlusion are gathered from a public source. Further, the pre-processing of the images is performed by contrast enhancement and Gabor filtering. With these pre-processed images, pattern extraction is done by the optimal local mesh ternary pattern. Here, the hybrid Whale–Galactic Swarm Optimization (WGSO) algorithm is used for developing the optimal local mesh ternary pattern extraction. By inputting the pattern-extracted image, the new deep learning model namely “CNN with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)” network performs the recognition process to maximize the accuracy, and also it is used to enhance the face recognition model. From the results, in terms of accuracy, the proposed WGSO-[Formula: see text] model is better by 4.02%, 3.76% and 2.17% than the CNN, SVM and SRC, respectively. The experimental results are presented by performing their comparative analysis on a standard dataset, and they assure the efficiency of the proposed model. However, many challenging problems related to face recognition still exist, which offer excellent opportunities to face recognition researchers in the future.",

Here, DNA steganography is used to protect secret data from intruders. In this paper, three different algorithms of DNA steganography are introduced. The algorithms are an RSA-based insertion algorithm, a complementary algorithm using the Addition/Subtraction rule, a combination of insertion and substitution method with XOR operation.

However, such techniques are ineffective for new types of attacks. In the preferred unsupervised and semi-supervised cases, these newer techniques suffer from lower accuracy and higher rates of false alarms. This work proposes a machine learning model that combines auto-encoder with one-class support vectors machine. In this model, the auto-encoders learn the representation of the input data in a latent space and reduces the dimensionality of the input data. The dimensionality-reduced input is then extracted from the auto-encoder and passed to a one-class support vectors machine to classify the network event as an attack or a normal event. The model is trained on normal network events only. The proposed model is then evaluated and compared with several existing models. It achieves high accuracy when tested on the NSL-KDD and KDD99 datasets, with total accuracies of 96.24% and 99.45%, respectively.",

Reading about infrastructure countermeasures, before or after reading about a cyber-attack, did not improve or maintain the subjects’ optimism and self-efficacy. A possible explanation is that emotional arousal may override or block rational thinking. Another explanation may be that a nationwide attack is towards the infrastructure and not the personal computer. Here the individual lacks any control.

An accountable AC-OT (AAC-OT) scheme is an enhanced version of AC-OT that allows the DBP to revoke the access rights of malicious users. However, existing AAC-OT schemes have defects in their security model definition, malicious user revocation mechanism, and user-side performance. Therefore, the authors proposed an improved AAC-OT scheme that applies to the public cloud environment. In the definition of the security model, the definitions of access authorization and revocation are considered. By modifying the user tracing mechanism, the DBP can independently revoke the access rights of fraudulent users. In addition, the number of bilinear pairing operations performed by users in the transfer phase is kept constant by optimizing the generation of the underlying zero-knowledge proofs.",

In order to solve the problem of limited resources such as computing power and storage space of mobile devices, a group signature algorithm with a shorter signature length is adopted. And smart phone is used as mobile payment proxy for smart devices. For user privacy protection, anonymous mobile payment and device use among family members are realized. This protocol uses group signatures and challenge-response based secure mutual identity authentication to resist parallel sessions, replay, man-in-the-middle, denial of service and other attacks in the network. Moreover, the complexity of protocol interactions of mobile payment and device use is reduced from O(n) to O(1). Finally, the indistinguishability game proof and analysis show that the proposed protocol in this paper can realize the anonymity of family members and meet the security requirements of the system, such as mutual identity authentication and traceability, and has certain application prospects in the smart home market.",

People, however, often click the OK button without reading warning messages. We utilize eye gaze information to provide dynamic warnings. The dynamic warnings are designed to display just-in-time and then fade out after users read them. They are shown right next to the location where users look. We built a restaurant reservation app to evaluate our dynamic warning system. We conducted an experiment with follow-up surveys. The results showed that our dynamic warnings reduced unnecessary identity disclosure and that they were around 5 times more effective than a Windows warning with a close button. We also found that the longer users’ eyes registered on dynamic warning, the less likely users were to provide their identify information in the dynamic warning condition experiment.",

Events are buffered in memory, up to a configurable threshold, before being streamed in real time using live streaming technologies. The framework deploys virtualized data collecting agents that ingest data from multiple sources including threat intelligence. The framework enables the correlation of events from various sources, improving detection precision. The authors have tested the framework in a real time, machine-learning-based threat detection system. The results show a time gain of 300 milliseconds in transmission time from event capture to analytics system, compared with storage-based collection frameworks.

Hence, a secure method is highly required to get a satisfying security level while keeping the computational complexity reduced.

A proxy signature scheme is a kind of digital signature scheme that allows an original signer to designate his/her signing capacity to a proxy signer. The proxy signer generates a signature on a message on behalf of the original signer. Such signatures are very useful in various applications where the delegation rights is quite common, especially in distributed systems and grid computing. This paper presents a pairing-free proxy signature with message recovery scheme that integrates the advantages of proxy signatures and message recovery in identity based setting. This scheme improves the computational and communicational efficiency due to pairing-free and message recovery features. The proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model under the hardness assumption of the ECDLP.

In this paper, a new fine-grained decentralized data access control technique with user revocation has been proposed. Here, service provider is responsible for verifying the user authenticity. The proposed schema supports integrity checking and user revocation. The integrity checking proof validates that the user data is intact and revocation mechanism will help to revoke the user in linear time.

The rook is a chess piece that moves only forward and backward in a straight line. In binary bit plane, 0 and 1 are considered as a black and white opponent rook, respectively. The secret information is considered as stream of binary bits. The binary bits of secret information are compared with the functional output of the corresponding block.

To overcome the storage representation of data provenance, they propose JavaScript object notation (JSON) structure.

To implement the JSON structure and ACL rules, permissioned blockchain based tool “Hyperledger Composer” has been used.

However, there is a minor issue arising in the classifier's incapability to process high-dimensional data. Using several classifiers always outperforms a single classifier's performance. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection system by classifying data with SVM as well as C4.5 decision tree algorithm. The NSL-KDD dataset is first preprocessed with principal component analysis (PCA) and later feature selected with an improved particle swarm optimization (I-PSO). This framework improved the time consumption and inaccurate feature selection issues in other methodologies. Upon simplifying features more effectively, the outcomes display an excellent agreement with the conventional PSO techniques and their results, and also produce enhanced outcomes when compared to only single classifier. The results demonstrate better performance when subject to different attack-scenarios and can be used for enterprise network security applications.",

Given a data sample to classify, DS-kNN computes the distance sum of the k-nearest neighbors of the data sample in each of the possible classes of the dataset.

Due to their inherent characteristics of open medium, very dynamic topology, lack of infrastructure and lack of centralized management authority, IoT present serious vulnerabilities to security attacks. The routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) does not have an inherent mechanism to detect routing attacks. Popular among these IoT attacks is blackhole attack. An attacker can exploit the routing system of RPL to launch blackhole attack against an IoT network. To secure IoT networks from blackhole attack, trust-integrated RPL protocol (TRPL) is proposed and implemented. The trust system is embedded in the RPL protocol to detect and isolate a blackhole attack while optimizing network performance. The trust is calculated from successful interaction between two nodes. The calculated trust value is considered in parent selection. TRPL demonstrates its superior performance over the standard RPL protocol and existing techniques in the detection and isolation of blackhole attacks.",

This approach can detect known malware very effectively but sometimes may fail to detect unknown or zero-day attacks. In this article, the authors have proposed a malware detection model that uses operation codes of malicious and benign executables as the feature. The proposed model uses opcode extract and count (OPEC) algorithm to prepare the opcode feature vector for the experiment. Most relevant features are selected using extra tree classifier feature selection technique and then passed through several supervised learning algorithms like support vector machine, naive bayes, decision tree, random forest, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbour to build classification models for malware detection. The proposed model has achieved a detection accuracy of 98.7%, which makes this model better than many of the similar works discussed in the literature.",

In this paper, a novel algorithmic procedure is presented to authenticate the legal client based on empirical threshold values obtained from the timing information of the client's keystroke dynamics. The exploratory outcomes demonstrate an impressive diminish in both false rejection rate and false acceptance rate. Equal error rate and authentication accuracy are also assessed to show the superiority and robustness of the method.

In the substitution stage, pixel values are mixed with a pseudorandom sequence generated from the 4D chaotic system using XOR operation.

A number of variants of DV-Hop-based localization algorithms have been proposed and their performance is measured in terms of localization error. In all these algorithms, while determining the location of a non-anchor node, all the anchor nodes are taken into consideration. However, if only the anchors close to the node are considered, it will be possible to reduce the localization error significantly. This paper explores the effect of the close anchors in the performance of the DV-Hop-based localization algorithms and an improvement is proposed by considering only the closest anchors. The simulation results show that considering closest anchors for estimation of the location reduces localization error significantly as compared to considering all the anchors.",

An effective IDS constitutes of less time-consuming algorithm with less space complexity and higher accuracy. To do so, the number of features are reduced while maintaining minimal loss of information. In this paper, the authors have proposed a model by which the features are selected on the basis of mutual information gain among correlated features.

To mitigate it, organizations use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) as part of the security infrastructure, to detect this type of attack. However, the authors observe a gap between the comprehensive state-of-the-art in detecting SQL Injection attacks and the state-of-practice regarding existing tools capable of detecting such attacks. The majority of IDS implementations provide little or no protection against SQL Injection attacks, with exceptions like the tools Bro and ModSecurity. In this article, the authors compare these tools using the CSIC dataset in order to examine the state-of-practice in database protection from SQL Injection attacks, identifying the main characteristics and implementation details needed for IDSs to successfully detect such attacks. The experiments indicate that signature-based IDS provide the greatest coverage against SQL Injection.",

A majority of the existing SE schemes support SQL search query, i.e. 'Select * where (list of keywords).' However, applications for encrypted data analysis often need to count data matched with a query, instead of data extraction. For such applications, the execution of SQL aggregate query, i.e. 'Count * where (list of keywords)' at server is essential. Additionally, in case of semi-honest server, privacy of aggregate result is of primary concern. In this article, the authors propose an aggregate searchable encryption with result privacy (ASE-RP) that includes ASearch() algorithm. The proposed ASearch() performs aggregate operation (i.e. Count *) on the implicitly searched ciphertexts (for the conjunctive query) and outputs an encrypted result. The server, due to encrypted form of aggregate result, would not be able to get actual count unless having a decryption key and hence ASearch() offers result privacy.",

Anomaly-based IDS has established its effectiveness in identifying new and unseen attacks. It learns the normal usage pattern of a network and any event that significantly deviates from the normal behavior is signaled as an intrusion. The crucial challenge in anomaly-based IDS is to reduce false alarm rate. In this article, a clustering-based outlier detection (CBOD) approach is proposed for classifying normal and intrusive patterns. The proposed scheme operates in three modules: an improved hybrid feature selection phase that extracts the most relevant features, a training phase that learns the normal pattern in the training data by forming clusters, and a testing phase that identifies outliers in the testing data. The proposed method is applied for NSL-KDD benchmark dataset and the experimental results yielded a 97.84% detection rate (DR), a 1.88% false alarm rate (FAR), and a 97.96% classification accuracy (ACC). This proposal appears to be promising in terms of DR, FAR and ACC.",

Among them, the significant one is LEACH (low-energy adaptive cluster hierarchical) that accomplishes the objective of energy balancing by occasionally varying the CHs in the region. Nevertheless, since it implements a random number method, the appropriateness of the CH is full of suspicions. As a result, this work intends to discover the optimal cluster head selection (CHS) model for maximizing energy aware and secured routing in WSN. Here, optimal CH is chosen based upon constraints such as “trust evaluation (direct and indirect trust), distance, security (risk level evaluation), distance, energy and delay”. In addition, the routing model considers the path quality determination of cluster (reliability). For choosing the best CH in WSN, slime wrap food update with cat and mouse optimization (SWFU-CMO) is deployed. Finally, the simulated outcomes verify the efficacy of presented approach related to residual energy, throughput, delay, etc.",

The authors propose a trajectory data publication method based on differential privacy (TDDP). TDDP method consists of two stages. In the location generalization stage, firstly, the locations at each timestamp are clustered into classes by k-means++ algorithm, and then the representative location of each class is selected by using the exponential mechanism. In the generalized trajectory data publication stage, the authors design a sampling mechanism to form the generalized trajectories. The locations are sampled from the representative locations under different timestamps to form the generalized trajectories. The TDDP method can avoid the generation of non-semantic representative locations and ensure that the generalized trajectories can resist filtering attacks.

Althrough there are various methods to analysis the behaviour of the malware, the innovation of new technology lead to undesirable growth of malware. A procedure to analyze the characteristics and its nature is the need of the day. To mitigate this issue, malware specific procedures need to be evolved by analysing its behaviour. In this article, the authors present a heuristic-based malware static analysis testing (HMST) through a six step process including hash verification, PE structure analysis, packer signature analysis, entropy analysis, antivirus check and string analysis. Heuristic-based malware static analysis (MSA) depends on the six characterstics. The six characteristics sequence is quantified mathematially. Hash verification is presented as a dynamic function, PE structure analysis (PESA) as the functional string, Packer Signature (PS) by functional boundedness, Entropy Analysis (EA) with probability, antivirus check (AC) of the discrete lagorthm-bit representation and string analysis (SA) lies with the comutational complexity.

Twitter is one of the popular social platforms for expressing thoughts in the form of tweets. Nowadays, tweets are widely used for analyzing the sentiments of the users, and utilized for decision making purposes. Though clustering and classification methods are used for the twitter sentiment analysis, meta-heuristic based clustering methods has witnessed better performance due to subjective nature of tweets. However, sequential meta-heuristic based clustering methods are computation intensive for large scale datasets. Therefore, in this paper, a novel MapReduce based K-means biogeography based optimizer(MR-KBBO) is proposed to leverage the strength of biogeography based optimizer with MapReduce model to efficiently cluster the large scale data. The proposed method is validated against four state-of-the-art MapReduce based clustering methods namely; parallel K-means, parallel K-means particle swarm optimization, MapReduce based artificial bee colony optimization, dynamic frequency based parallel k-bat algorithm on four large scale twitter datasets. Further, speedup measure is used to illustrate the computation performance on varying number of nodes.

Most of the authentication protocols designed and implemented so far for entity authentication are based on classical cryptographic techniques to prevent themselves from different types of attacks. These protocols use either password or challenge for authentication. In this article, the design of the proposed quantum secure entity authentication protocol is shown. The proposed protocol is based on the challenge response method. Due to quantum computer capability to break mathematical complexity-based cryptographic techniques, the proposed protocol uses the one-time pad (OTP) to secure itself from attacks, i.e., eavesdropping, reply attack, password guessing attack, man-in-the-middle attack, brute-force attack, quantum computer attack, etc. Security of the proposed protocol was analyzed, and it shows that the proposed protocol may prevent itself from different types of attacks. Further, analysis for quantum Secure was carried out. From the analysis, it is found that if the OTP key is truly random and cannot be reused, then a computer with infinite capacity or quantum computer cannot break the encrypted challenge and response. The proposed protocol may be used for entity authentication for the client, server, process, and user.",

However, outsourcing private data to a cloud server is insecure without an efficient access control strategy. Thus, it is important to protect the data and privacy of user with a fine-grained access control policy. In this article, a Bloom Filter-based Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (BF-CP-ABE) technique is presented to provide data security to cloud datasets with a Linear Secret Sharing Structure (LSSS) access policy. This fine-grained access control scheme hides the whole attribute set in the ciphertext, whereas in previous CP-ABE methods, the attributes are partially hidden in the ciphertext which in turn leaks private information about the user. Since the attribute set of the BF-CP-ABE technique is hidden, bloom filters are used to identify the authorized users during data decryption. The BF-CP-ABE technique is designed to be selective secure under an Indistinguishable-Chosen Plaintext attack and the simulation results show that the communication overhead is significantly reduced with the adopted LSSS access policy.",

The SOAP messages are used to establish communication between the web services which are vulnerable to rewriting attacks and insecure conversation. XML Signature as specified in WS-Security provides security to the contents of the SOAP messages but is insufficient. This paper proposes a SOAP model where rewriting attacks can be avoided and a secure conversation can be established as well. This paper recommends three steps, firstly using shared key for encrypting timestamp in the message body for generating corresponding signature; Secondly, using value referencing both for signature validation and message processing; and finally encrypting the whole SOAP body instead of sending an open SOAP Message in the network to prevent unauthorized access. The paper concludes that the proposed model successfully detects rewriting attacks and establishes secure conversation in the to-and-fro message transmission.",

This became one the flaws of computer security that needs to be handled. In order to establish a secure data communication, many data security techniques were developed to ensure privacy, integrity and authenticity. One of the techniques developed was to fulfill authentication with a message authentication code (MAC) that was defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. It is still a powerful data integrity and authentication tool that provides better protection than error detection codes or checksums. In this article, the authors propose a new cipher-based message authentication code (CMAC) algorithm. Their proposed algorithm, termed SEC-CMAC, is based on a previously developed symmetric evolutionist ciphering algorithm named symmetrical evolutionist ciphering (SEC). Compared to the well-known previously developed MAC, their suggested algorithm proved to be robust and fulfill some security requirement by resisting an exhaustive key search and mac forgery attacks.",

This non-invasive attack first extracts the power consumption details from devices embedded with cryptographic techniques and then uses these details to mount attacks on the cryptosystems to reveal the secret key. However, at times there appears multiple similar power peaks at the same points. This raises confusion in distinguishing the actual and the fake peaks named “ghost peaks.” This ghost peak problem affects the efficiency of power analysis attacks as it increases the number of power traces to be evaluated to identify the actual peak. In this article, the authors present an approach which uses the Canberra distance with Euclidean similarity to address this ghost peak problem. The proposed solution diminishes the values of all these ghost peaks, leaving only the actual peak behind that could reveal the secret key.",

In a hospital setting medical staff across departments often needs to access patient data without directly obvious reasons, which makes it difficult to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate access. This article provides a mechanism to classify transactions at a large university medical center into plausible and questionable data access using a real-life data set of more than 60,000 transactions. The classification mechanism works with minimal data requirements and unsupervised data sets. The results were evaluated through manual cross-checks internally and by a group of external experts.

With the help of data mining techniques, people can extract hidden information and discover patterns and relationships between the data items. In most of the situations, the extracted knowledge contains sensitive information about individuals and organizations. Moreover, this sensitive information can be misused for various purposes which violate the individual's privacy. Association rules frequently predetermine significant target marketing information about a business. Significant association rules provide knowledge to the data miner as they effectively summarize the data, while uncovering any hidden relations among items that hold in the data. Association rule hiding techniques are used for protecting the knowledge extracted by the sensitive association rules during the process of association rule mining. Association rule hiding refers to the process of modifying the original database in such a way that certain sensitive association rules disappear without seriously affecting the data and the non-sensitive rules. In this article, two new hiding techniques are proposed namely hiding technique based on genetic algorithm (HGA) and dummy items creation (DIC) technique. Hiding technique based on genetic algorithm is used for hiding sensitive association rules and the dummy items creation technique hides the sensitive rules as well as it creates dummy items for the modified sensitive items.

So, this paper proposes a new scheme (Moye) that tackles this challenge by protecting queries to be linked to specific sensitive data. Specifically, the proposed solution is based on the design of a hybrid implementation of public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) and subset membership encryption (SME) cryptosystem to enhance both data and query privacy protection.

To establish an immutable data provenance scheme for CPS, the authors adopt blockchain and propose a decentralized architecture to assure data integrity. In business-driven CPS, end users are required to share their personal information with multiple third parties. To prevent data leakage and preserve user privacy, the authors isolate and feed different information retrieval requests using tokens specifically generated for each type of request. Providing both traceability of data operations, and unlinkability of end user activities, a robust blockchain-based CPS is prototyped. Evaluation indicates the architecture is capable of assured data provenance validation and user privacy preservation at a low overhead.",

To investigate the extent of this problem, second-hand memory cards were procured from the Australian eBay site between 2011 and 2015. Digital forensic tools were used to acquire and analyze each memory card to determine the type and quantity of remnant data. This paper presents the results of the 2014 and 2015 studies and compares these findings to the 2011–2013 research studies. The longitudinal comparison indicates resold memory cards are disposed insecurely, with personal, confidential and business data undeleted or easily recoverable.

Such collected data, however, may also contain sensitive data about an individual. Thus, when analyzing such data, individual privacy can be breached. Therefore, to preserve individual privacy, one can find numerous approaches proposed for the same in the literature. One of the solutions proposed in the literature is k-anonymity which is used along with the clustering approach. During the investigation, the authors observed that the k-anonymization based clustering approaches all the times result in the loss of information. This paper presents a fractional calculus-based bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (FC-BFO) to generate an optimal cluster. In addition to this, the authors utilize the concept of fractional calculus (FC) in the chemotaxis step of a bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm. The main objective is to improve the optimization ability of the BFO algorithm. The authors also evaluate their proposed FC-BFO algorithm, empirically, focusing on information loss and execution time as a vital metric. The experimental evaluations show that our proposed FC-BFO algorithm generates an optimal cluster with lesser information loss as compared with the existing clustering approaches.",

Communication parameters used in calculating trust value in most of existing trust based protocol wireless network are number of successful session or packet forwarded between two nodes, number of packet dropped or delayed, response time, battery life, mobility of node etc. This paper provides analysis of existing trust based routing by surveying current \"sate of the art\" work in this area.

Most of the (n, n) secret sharing schemes suffer from one common flaw — locking of information when the all- n number of receivers are not available for some reason. This paper proposes a new method of compartmented secret sharing scheme where some threshold number of equally privileged from each compartment can retrieve data. This scheme rules out regeneration of secret image at the single compartment thereby eliminating the danger of misusing secret image. The key features of this scheme are: better visual quality of the recovered image with no pixel expansion; non-requirement of half toning of color images; less computational complexity by reconstructing secret through XORing and simple addition of all share images. This scheme is highly beneficial in applications where data has to be stored securely in a database and in cloud computing to synchronize information passed to different groups or clusters from a single host.",

In this paper, a technique to prevent identity disclosure through structure attacks has been proposed which not only prevents identity disclosure but also preserves utility of data published by online social networks. Algorithms have been developed by using noise nodes/edges with the consideration of introducing minimum change in the original graphical structure of social networks. The authors' work is unique in the sense that previous works are based on edge editing only but their proposed work protects against structure attacks using mutual nodes in the social network and the effectiveness of the proposed technique has been proved using APL Average Path Length and information loss as parameters.",

Particularly, cryptographic algorithms have gained more popularity to protect the communication in a hostile environment. As the critical information that is being transferred over the wireless adhoc networks can be easily acquired and is vulnerable to many security attacks. However, several security communication threats had been detected and defended using conventional symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic mechanism, which are too difficult and resource consuming for such mobile adhoc networks. Recently, one of the severe security threats that have to be detected and defend in any type of network topology is blackhole attack and cooperative blackhole. Because of its severity, the black hole attack has attracted a great deal of attention in the research community. Comprehensively the results of the existing system conclude that the black hole attack on various mobile adhoc networks is hard to detect and easy to implement. This paper addresses to detect and defend the blackhole attack and cooperative blackhole attack using hybrid DNA-based cryptography HDC mechanism. Moreover, the proposed method upsurge the security issue with the underlying AODV routing protocol. Eventually, This Hybrid DNA-based Cryptography HDC is one of the high potential candidates for advanced wireless ad hoc networks, which require less communication bandwidth and memory in comparison with other cryptographic systems. The simulation results of this proposed method provide better security and network performances as compared to existing schemes.",

Rising number of metamorphic malwares entails hardship in analyzing them for signature extraction and database updates. In spite of the broad use of signature-based methods in the security products, they are not able detect the new unseen morphs of malware, and it is stemmed from changing the structure of malware as well as the signature in each infection. In this paper, a novel method is proposed in which the proportion of opcodes is used for detecting the new morphs. Decision trees are utilized for classification and detection of malware variants based on the rate of opcode frequencies. Three metrics for evaluating the proposed method are speed, efficiency and accuracy. It was observed in the course of experiments that speed and time complexity will not be challenging factors; because of the fast nature of extracting the frequencies of opcodes from source assembly file.

The proposed specification-based detection approach relies on a set of specifications automatically generated, while anomaly-detection uses statistical techniques.

The current use of anonymization techniques is not quite efficient because of its failure to use the structure of the datasets under consideration and inability to use a metric that balances the usefulness of information with privacy preservation. In this work, an adaptive lossy decomposition algorithm was developed for preserving privacy in cloud computing.

These forms of privacy preserving mining work well for data centralized at a single site. Moreover the amount of information hidden during mining is not sufficient. When perturbation approaches are used, data reconstruction is a major challenge. This paper aims at modeling classifiers for data distributed across various sites with respect to the same instances. The homomorphic and probabilistic property of Paillier is used to perform secure product, mean and variance calculations. The secure computations are performed without any intermediate data or the sensitive data at multiple sites being revealed.

As such, a Web-based portal for sharing of user-generated content (e.g., course notes, quiz answers, etc.) shows prospect to be a great tool for social E-Learning. Among others, students are expected to be active contributors in such systems in order to offer and receive peer-help. However, privacy and territoriality concerns can be potential barriers to wide adoption of such technology. Understanding the preference for sharing learning content is the first step to address privacy and territoriality concerns of content providers. The authors conduct a survey among students in four university courses in order to learn their preference for sharing notes and quiz answers with three target groups: instructor, peer, and stranger (i.e., someone outside their class). The authors also examine the preference for acceptable method of sharing by inquiring about three methods: “anonymous sharing,” “pseudonymous sharing,” and “sharing with name”. They further investigate the importance of “content type,” “sharing method,” and “accessor type” on the preference for sharing. The survey also reveals respondents' self-reported reasons for controlling access to their generated learning content. The survey data indicate that even though the respondents have various levels of concerns, almost all of them are willing to share. The authors observe relationships between content type and respondents' preference over each of these parameters: accessor type, commentator type, and sharing method.",

Findings: Files uploaded in the cloud are encrypted using traditional encryption algorithms which don't provide high levels of security. Files can be accessed by anyone who is authorized. Privileges are not considered. During de-duplication, only the name and size of the files are considered. Application: Files within the public cloud can't be viewed by everyone who has registered with the cloud. Those who have the respective privileges can only view the file. Proof of Ownership is assured. Since de-duplication is done based on the content redundancy within the cloud storage is avoided. Usage of OTP ensures that the content is viewed by the individuals who have the respective privileges related to the file. These concepts provide additional security to the files stored in the public environment.",

In majority of the cryptosystems the crucial arithmetic operation is modular exponentiation. It is composed of a series of modular multiplications. Hence, the performance of any cryptosystem is strongly depends on the efficient implementation of these operations. This paper presents the Bit Forwarding 3-bitsBFW3 technique for efficient implementation of modular exponentiation. The modular multiplication involved in BFW3 is evaluated with the help of Montgomery method. These techniques improves the performance by reducing the frequency of modular multiplications. Results shows that the BFW3 technique is able to reduce the frequency of multiplications by 18.20% for 1024-bit exponent. This reduction resulted in increased throughput of 18.11% in comparison with MME42_C2 at the cost of 1.09% extra area. The power consumption reduced by 8.53% thereby saving the energy up to 10.10%.",

These include Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SCADA Systems and Distributed Control Systems DCS. ICS typically perform the \"Command and Control\" operations required for smooth functioning of machines in industrial production. They are widely used in Critical infrastructures such as power generation and distribution systems, Oil and Gas plants, Chemical factories and various other manufacturing facilities. Traditionally, ICS used proprietary protocols and operated in isolation. Perimeter security was considered enough as the only means to compromise these systems was via physical access to the systems. However, increased standardization, open architecture adoption and connectivity to enterprise networks as well as internet opened up these systems for a wide range of audience and enabled remote attacks. In this new operation landscape, it is imperative that newer means of securing the networks are adopted continuously. One of the security considerations for the ICS networks is the communication paths used by these networks. Public Key Infrastructure PKI n.d. plays a key role in securing the communication of ICS networks. Using Digital Certificates, PKI provides a mechanism to verify the identity of all the entities on a network and also ensures that the information is shared securely between communicating entities. PKI is a proven mechanism for secure communication and is widely used in many organizations. However, PKI as a solution to ICS security is challenging due to factors such as resource constrained environments, bandwidth considerations and hard real-time communication requirements. This paper intends to focus on key challenges in Digital Certificate management and correct deployment of PKI in ICS networks and will also present recommendations to overcome these challenges without compromising the basic functionalities of ICS.",

Still PKI ensures a secure method for exchanging sensitive information over unsecured channels through the use of cryptographic public private key pair, issued by Certification Authority (CA) but even an honest CA can issue forged certificate.

Network security plays important role of protecting information, hardware and software on a computer network. Denial of service (DOS) attacks causes great impacts on the internet world. These attacks attempt to disrupt legitimate user's access to services. By exploiting computer's vulnerabilities, attackers easily consume victim's resources. Many special techniques have been developed to protest against DOS attacks. Some organizations constitute several defense mechanism tools to tackle the security problems. This paper has proposed various types of attacks and solutions associated with each layers of OSI model. These attacks and solutions have different impacts on the different environment. Thus the rapid growth of new technologies may constitute still worse impacts of attacks in the future.",

This type of attack is accomplished by exploiting web browsers and plugins vulnerabilities. The damage may include data leakage leading to financial loss. Traditional antivirus and intrusion detection systems are not efficient against such attacks. Researchers proposed plenty of detection approaches mostly passive blacklisting. However, a few proposed dynamic classification techniques, which suffer from clear shortcomings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect drive-by download infected web pages based on extracted features from their source code. We test 23 different machine learning classifiers using data set of 5435 webpages and based on the detection accuracy we selected the top five to build our detection model. The approach is expected to serve as a base for implementing and developing anti drive-by download programs. We develop a graphical user interface program to allow the end user to examine the URL before visiting the website. The Bagged Trees classifier exhibited the highest accuracy of 90.1% and reported 96.24% true positive and 26.07% false positive rate.",

Hence, it is pertinent to focus fundamentally on studying the queue scheduling policies of web server against the HTTP request flooding attack which has been the base of this research work. In this paper, the various types of AL-DDoS attacks launched by exploiting the HTTP protocol have been reviewed. The key aim is to compare the requests queue scheduling policies of web server against HTTP request flooding attack using NS2 simulator.

It achieves detecting the attack at the destination and filtering the malicious traffic at the source and can be easily implemented in SDN controller program, software or programmable switch, such as Open vSwitch and NetFPGA.

If attacked, the damaged watermarks cannot provide sufficient evidence in front of a court. To address this issue, the authors present a signature restoration scheme. The thought of secret sharing is introduced to share the signature into small watermarks. These watermarks are encoded with Reed-Solomon RS codes and embedded into unused lookup tables LUTs of used slices. Unlike most of existing techniques, the proposed scheme can restore the signature only by extracting parts of watermarks. So, it is tolerant to some damaged watermarks caused by removal attacks. The experiments show that the proposed scheme incurs no extra hardware resource and timing overhead. The robustness against attacks is much better by comparing to other schemes.",

In this paper, the authors reviewed the major techniques in the field of ubiquitous mobile access authentication, which has attracted many researchers in the past decade.

SDN (Software Defined Networking) is a potential solution to future IB networks, however, there are still few studies on SDN-based IB networks. In this paper, we have proposed a secure SDN framework named as S2Net, offering authentication and key agreement between the central controller and smart devices. In addition, we have designed a secure OpenFlow message issuing protocol for IB networks, it is used to securely exchange messages between the controller and smart devices.

Secure speaker recognition makes use of Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) based on the homomorphic properties of cryptosystem. Among the cryptosytem with homomorphic properties BGN is preferable, because it is partially doubly homomorphic, which can perform arbitrary number of addition and only one multiplication. But the main disadvantage of using BGN cryptosystem is its execution time. In proposed system, the execution time is reduced by a factor of 12 by replacing conventional composite order group by prime order group. This leads to an efficient secure speaker recognition.",

The protocol should guarantee that an attacker or an unidentified resource will not breach or forward the information. For secure communication among members of a grid group, an authenticated message transferring system should be implemented. The key objective of this system is to provide a secure transferring path between a sender and its authenticated group members. In recent times, many researchers have proposed various steganographic techniques for secure message communications. This paper proposes a new secure message broadcasting system to hide the messages in such a way that an attacker cannot sense the existence of messages. In the proposed system, the authors use steganography and image encryption to hide group keys and secret messages using group keys in images for secure message broadcasting. The proposed system can withstand against conspiracy attack, message modification attack and various other security attacks.
